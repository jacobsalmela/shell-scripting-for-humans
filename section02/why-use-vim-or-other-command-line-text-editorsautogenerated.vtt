That was a lot of work just to get some text written to a file.

1
00:07.240 --> 00:16.790
I had to open the editor press, "i", type some text, press, escape, press, ":wq" to quit and

2
00:16.790 --> 00:20.480
save and probably just feels like a step backwards, but--

3
00:22.100 --> 00:27.470
especially if you've done it for the first time in this lecture.  But vim is actually really powerful.

4
00:28.130 --> 00:32.150
And one of the main reasons is that you never have to take your hands off the keyboard.

5
00:32.910 --> 00:37.490
You can quickly jump in and out of editing a file and then run your script to make sure it worked.

6
00:38.630 --> 00:42.470
And you can even run commands from inside the editor, which is kind of cool.

7
00:43.100 --> 00:48.770
And if you actually wrote your script in, like Microsoft Word, you'd end up with a lot more than just

8
00:48.770 --> 00:49.400
your text.

9
00:49.400 --> 00:54.220
You'd get formatting and metadata that your show is just not going to understand.

10
00:55.310 --> 00:58.870
And back in the early days of Linux, all you had was the command line.

11
00:58.880 --> 01:01.750
You didn't have those nice graphical interfaces.

12
01:02.540 --> 01:09.140
So being able to write, you know, more than one line on the command line is really, really nice.

13
01:11.030 --> 01:13.310
So for the rest of this course, we're going to be using vim.

14
01:14.240 --> 01:19.760
And if you're feeling nervous about that, don't worry, because it's going to get a lot easier to use

15
01:20.090 --> 01:22.090
once you practice it a little bit more.

16
01:23.150 --> 01:28.280
And then once you reach a certain point, you'll start to see how valuable it can be to use it.

17
01:29.300 --> 01:32.790
There's even many professional programmers that use it as their only editor.

18
01:33.380 --> 01:35.690
So congratulations on writing your first script in vim!

19
01:35.690 --> 01:42.680
You learned about the shebang, how to write a comment, the echo and printf commands, and

20
01:42.680 --> 01:44.480
how to write a file and quit vim.

21
01:45.440 --> 01:51.020
In the next section, you're going to run a script and then you'll continue to create and run new scripts

22
01:51.020 --> 01:52.100
with new commands.

23
01:52.520 --> 01:57.380
So there's going to be just a lot of repeating of that and you'll also get some more practice using

24
01:57.380 --> 01:57.680
vim.
