In this lesson, I'm going to teach you how to add a comment to your script.  So you actually already

1
00:08.340 --> 00:14.010
added one here since to actually write a comment, you'll be using this hash tag sign.

2
00:15.390 --> 00:21.690
So I'll just press enter once and then you'll get to the next line and then you can write the hash sign

3
00:22.500 --> 00:24.720
and then whatever comment you want.

4
00:26.130 --> 00:27.650
'this is my second script to write

5
00:33.680 --> 00:42.260
text to the screen'.  The comments as a second line is a very useful thing to do because it can basically

6
00:42.470 --> 00:47.570
tell you what your script is going to do, whether that's you reading it or somebody else.

7
00:48.120 --> 00:49.960
It's just a--you don't have to put it there,

8
00:49.970 --> 00:57.710
but I like to do it because it's easy to remember and then it's helpful for yourself.  And you don't need

9
00:57.710 --> 00:59.360
the space here, but you can put it here.

10
00:59.510 --> 01:01.310
I like to put it there just for the styling.

11
01:02.430 --> 01:07.510
What makes it a little bit easier to read and you'll notice some people will do, you know, some people

12
01:07.510 --> 01:14.640
will use capitalization and correct punctuation, but it's really up to you how you want to do it.

13
01:15.600 --> 01:21.840
But you just have to make sure this comment character is there and then you can type whatever you want

14
01:21.840 --> 01:23.310
and it won't get executed.

15
01:23.880 --> 01:28.860
So if you ran your script right now, it would just do nothing because there's no actual commands being

16
01:28.860 --> 01:29.220
run.

17
01:30.270 --> 01:36.810
So in the next lecture, you'll write another echo command to print some text to the screen and then

18
01:37.680 --> 01:39.870
we'll save your file and then we'll run it.
