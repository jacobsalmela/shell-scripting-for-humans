Well, your first script is written.

1
00:05.960 --> 00:07.520
You've got your shebang up here.

2
00:08.690 --> 00:15.400
You've got your comment, then you've got two lines to print text to the screen in two different ways,

3
00:16.610 --> 00:17.640
But how do you save it?

4
00:18.260 --> 00:19.350
How do you save your file?

5
00:20.360 --> 00:25.490
So remember, I said there was different modes that there are in vim?  Right now,

6
00:25.490 --> 00:30.530
you're in insert mode, which just lets you type text however you want.

7
00:31.220 --> 00:39.320
So if you hit escape key once--see that insert disappeared now?  Now you're in what's called Command

8
00:39.320 --> 00:39.740
Mode.

9
00:40.250 --> 00:44.750
There's no actual indicator that you're in this mode except that there's just nothing down here.

10
00:45.920 --> 00:51.980
And it's the default mode that you get into when you first opened vim, which is why you had to press

11
00:51.980 --> 00:53.900
"i" to go into Insert Mode.

12
00:55.220 --> 01:03.020
So now that you're in Command Mode type ":w" to write the file and then press enter.

13
01:04.280 --> 01:10.730
So there there you see the script is written, which is the same as saving it, but you're still actually

14
01:10.730 --> 01:11.560
in the editor.

15
01:12.320 --> 01:13.940
So how do you actually quit out of it?

16
01:14.120 --> 01:18.140
The same way: press ":".

17
01:18.650 --> 01:25.820
But this time do "q" for quit. Press enter and then you're back at your command line and your script has

18
01:25.820 --> 01:26.510
been saved.
