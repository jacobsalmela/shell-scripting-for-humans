All right, so if your screen doesn't look like this does right now and you've got some other weird

1
00:08.370 --> 00:14.490
stuff on there, it's probably easier at this point just to close your window and then open it again

2
00:15.480 --> 00:16.530
and just type 'vim

3
00:16.530 --> 00:18.190
second_script.sh' and press enter.

4
00:19.890 --> 00:27.780
So once you're here, all I want you to do is just press the letter "i" once.  So you'll see this change

5
00:27.780 --> 00:28.490
to insert.

6
00:29.430 --> 00:35.090
That means you can write text however you want now, and it's called Insert Mode.

7
00:35.430 --> 00:39.840
It's one of a few different modes that I'm going to show you about, but this is the one you'll use

8
00:39.840 --> 00:42.330
the most because you're just going to be writing text.

9
00:43.620 --> 00:44.850
So here's what I want

10
00:44.850 --> 00:46.110
your first line to be:

11
00:49.410 --> 00:54.180
basically the hash sign, exclamation point, bin bash 
(#!/bin/bash)

12
00:56.430 --> 01:02.180
And then that should always be the first line of code that you're going to write any time you do a shell

13
01:02.190 --> 01:06.030
script, I'll teach you what this line is in the next lesson.

14
01:06.210 --> 01:13.290
But basically, I want you to remember from this lesson that once you open them, you press "i" once and

15
01:13.290 --> 01:14.970
then you can just type your text as normal.
