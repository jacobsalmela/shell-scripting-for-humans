00:03.140 --> 00:09.290
So the while--'while' loop is similar to a 'for' loop, but you can close it on a certain conditional.

1
00:10.610 --> 00:14.900
So the 'for' loop goes through a set amount of iterations and then is just done.

2
00:15.140 --> 00:16.900
The 'while' loop can go on forever.

3
00:18.090 --> 00:21.540
So if you typed in something like this:

4
00:22.870 --> 00:26.320
it would just loop forever, and that's called an infinite loop.

5
00:26.560 --> 00:30.040
So you want to try to avoid those because it's just never going to end.

6
00:31.490 --> 00:35.520
So the 'while' loop is good for a couple of different things.

7
00:35.530 --> 00:38.320
We used it for those 'getopts', get options.

8
00:39.580 --> 00:42.910
It's also good for reading a file line-by-line.

9
00:43.600 --> 00:52.920
So you can say 'while read line do'-- go 'echo $line'.  Just put a 'sleep 1' in there so you can see it happening,

10
00:53.860 --> 00:54.340
'done'.

11
00:55.390 --> 00:57.580
And then you can tell it to use a certain file.

12
00:58.960 --> 01:01.690
This file should be on Linux and Mac.

13
01:03.070 --> 01:09.130
So there is just going to read through each file [scatting] and then it would just stop when it's done.

14
01:09.940 --> 01:14.500
So that would just go until there's no more lines in the file, which is different than a 'for' loop,

15
01:14.500 --> 01:19.870
because you could pass in any file of a different length and it would just keep going until the end

16
01:19.870 --> 01:20.980
of that file was reached.

17
01:22.090 --> 01:26.620
So likewise, in the code that you added in that last script

18
01:26.620 --> 01:27.100
we did,

19
01:31.690 --> 01:33.090
the parse_args.sh one,

20
01:41.480 --> 01:49.490
this was a 'while' loop, but it was only checking these things, so once it got through all of those

21
01:49.490 --> 01:51.820
arguments, then there was nothing left to do

22
01:51.830 --> 01:53.180
so it was done.

23
01:55.580 --> 01:58.910
And then next, I'm going to show you this 'case' statement.
