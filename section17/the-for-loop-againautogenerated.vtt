All right, so those things you saw in the last lecture with the getting options, those were using

1
00:10.610 --> 00:12.320
some loops you haven't seen yet.

2
00:13.070 --> 00:19.550
So I'm just going to cover the 'for' loop again real quick because it's useful and then it'll get your

3
00:19.550 --> 00:29.270
mind in the mode of loops. So you can just write these right on the command line 'for n in' "whatever"

4
00:29.270 --> 00:32.540
one to six--one two five 'do echo $n'

5
00:38.570 --> 00:47.720
'sleep' for one--one, two, three, four, five. So it's just a simple loop that lets you

6
00:47.720 --> 00:48.910
do something over and over.
