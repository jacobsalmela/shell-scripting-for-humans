OK, so I'm going to show you about this 'case' statement here, this says:

1
00:10.540 --> 00:13.090
'case' and then a variable name.

2
00:13.780 --> 00:18.700
So in this case, it's going to be 'opt', which is just going to loop through all these.

3
00:20.770 --> 00:28.870
So if it's a 'b', it's going to run this and then you close it out by saying there's nothing else to

4
00:28.870 --> 00:31.570
run here by using two semicolons.

5
00:31.570 --> 00:37.690
And you could add multiple lines of code here, but since there's only one, it's just easier to read

6
00:37.690 --> 00:38.410
with just one.

7
00:41.330 --> 00:47.630
And if it's an 'e'  it's going to do this function and then the '*' here, as I mentioned, will just be

8
00:47.630 --> 00:49.780
a default if it didn't find a match.

9
00:51.470 --> 00:57.380
And then in our case, it's going to use the--print this 'usage' function to show our helpline.

10
00:59.870 --> 01:05.690
So the key statement is useful if you want to do X, Y or Z, depending on what if you have a whole

11
01:05.690 --> 01:11.150
bunch of different things you want to do something different on, you can loop through them and then

12
01:11.150 --> 01:16.130
do a little 'case' statement and then have a default for if something doesn't match.
