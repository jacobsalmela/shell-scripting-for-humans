00:02.430 --> 00:08.880
So you can create your own variables for use in your scripts.  You can kind of think of a variable like

1
00:08.880 --> 00:09.600
a box.

2
00:09.870 --> 00:16.000
The box will stay the same, but you can put different things in it or it can be empty.

3
00:16.950 --> 00:19.540
So, like, this could be our box.

4
00:19.560 --> 00:20.460
It's a variable.

5
00:21.600 --> 00:27.880
But when we run it on the command line, we're telling it to put /tmp in the box and /Users in

6
00:27.880 --> 00:32.770
the box and then that variable will expand when our script is run.

7
00:33.840 --> 00:38.720
So instead of that variable, your box has these values in it.

8
00:39.390 --> 00:41.010
So that's all just kind of theory.

9
00:41.010 --> 00:44.980
But let's look at how you can actually make them in your scripts.

10
00:45.930 --> 00:56.540
So just clear my screen to get that stuff off there and I'm going to make a new variable called 'allegiance'.

11
00:57.030 --> 01:04.800
So the syntax here is a variable name of your choice, the equals sign, and then you set it to whatever

12
01:04.800 --> 01:05.700
you want it to equal.

13
01:06.660 --> 01:16.200
So I made a variable named 'allegiance' and I said it equal to the word 'dark', for the dark side of the

14
01:16.200 --> 01:16.620
force.

15
01:16.980 --> 01:22.860
So you can do 'echo $allegiance' and then it has your value in there.

16
01:23.940 --> 01:31.170
So create a new script called 'vars.sh', "i" for Insert Mode,

17
01:36.240 --> 01:39.210
'#!/bin/bash', a comment if you want

18
01:42.200 --> 01:51.780
'my first variable'.  'allegiance=dark', and then I'll just do a little echo.

19
02:05.600 --> 02:14.180
So so here I'm using this dollar sign syntax--is what will expand your variable, so I do dollar sign

20
02:14.180 --> 02:22.610
and then the variable name that I created.  Escape, ":wq".

21
02:27.070 --> 02:39.570
'chmod 755 vars.sh'. So you made your first variable and then now in the next section, you

22
02:39.570 --> 02:42.030
can run it and we'll see what's in it.
