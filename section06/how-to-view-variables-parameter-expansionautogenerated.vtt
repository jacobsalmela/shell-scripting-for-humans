Go ahead and run your script: './vars.sh'

1
00:07.820 --> 00:14.750
"Darth Vader follows the dark side." So your variable--I'm going to cat this file--

2
00:17.400 --> 00:25.920
Your variable was set to dark, and when you use this dollar sign syntax, it basically put down your

3
00:25.920 --> 00:28.470
value there instead of the variable name.

4
00:30.000 --> 00:36.690
So when you're doing this, this is called parameter expansion
[nerdy music] "Parameter expansion!"

5
00:37.770 --> 00:40.490
You can experiment a bit with this on the command line here.

6
00:41.340 --> 00:51.100
So let's make a new variable 'sneaking_suit="sold snake"'.

7
00:51.750 --> 00:57.300
So now if you're going to use spaces in your variable names, you have to put double quotes around them.

8
00:58.080 --> 01:00.060
Otherwise it won't work.

9
01:00.810 --> 01:02.280
Now, if I echo.

10
01:13.590 --> 01:16.130
my variable name...

11
01:18.200 --> 01:26.270
"Solid snake is in the sneaking suit." So if you happen to leave off the dollar sign, it's just going

12
01:26.270 --> 01:31.960
to say "sneaking_suit" because it doesn't know you're not telling it that this is a name of a variable.

13
01:32.060 --> 01:37.580
So in the next lecture, I'm going to teach you how to list out the actual variable name, which can

14
01:37.580 --> 01:38.650
be kind of useful.
