So shell scripting is actually very powerful, so...we've just only done some really simple examples here,

1
00:09.730 --> 00:15.580
just printing text to the screen, but there's companies out there that use it to install enterprise

2
00:15.580 --> 00:16.400
level software.

3
00:16.900 --> 00:26.740
So let's take Docker, for instance, its enterprise level software that works with all sorts of big

4
00:26.740 --> 00:27.520
companies.

5
00:30.200 --> 00:35.210
If you've never seen it before, it's just a popular piece of software, but if you go to get.docker.com

6
00:35.220 --> 00:39.590
you'll see that this is just a giant shell script.

7
00:41.880 --> 00:49.880
So if you--you could go into your command line and paste this in, you know, paste in these other commands,

8
00:51.520 --> 00:52.900
that's a really long script.

9
00:53.600 --> 00:56.540
But if you went in and ran all these commands by hand.

10
00:58.500 --> 01:04.290
You would end up with Docker installed, but they've done all the work for you, so you just have to

11
01:04.800 --> 01:08.290
basically run this script and it installed Docker for you.

12
01:09.180 --> 01:15.330
So there's some examples in the lecture notes if you want to look at some other software that uses shell

13
01:15.330 --> 01:18.510
scripts to install themselves.

14
01:18.750 --> 01:24.780
But the point of the lesson is that, you know, don't underestimate what shell scripts can do because

15
01:25.880 --> 01:30.440
there's a big enterprise companies out there that use them to install their software.
