Shell scripts can be used for all sorts of things, you can use them to manipulate text files, you

1
00:08.190 --> 00:14.040
can control services and applications on your computer, you can even deploy your own software using

2
00:14.040 --> 00:14.700
a shell script.

3
00:15.140 --> 00:19.440
It can be difficult to start learning sometimes because if you've never used Linux before, it's a deep

4
00:19.440 --> 00:20.190
learning curve.

5
00:21.000 --> 00:24.060
But I designed this course so you can do a lot of hands on typing.

6
00:24.390 --> 00:27.900
And then I broke those sections into small chunks.

7
00:27.900 --> 00:30.560
So it's really easy to pick up and just do one at a time.

8
00:30.870 --> 00:36.180
If you go through this entire course, you'll have 20 shell scripts and a template script that you can

9
00:36.180 --> 00:43.690
use to create feature scripts.  Even if you're not familiar with programming Linux or the command line,

10
00:44.280 --> 00:49.950
this course will be accessible to you because as long as you have a Mac, you can just follow along

11
00:49.950 --> 00:53.920
with all the steps that I do and you'll learn things as you go.

12
00:54.600 --> 00:58.590
So the first half of the course is pretty slow and intentionally that way.

13
00:59.130 --> 01:05.970
So you can follow along and kind of get used to it and there'll be some repetition of things so you

14
01:05.970 --> 01:07.980
can get a firm understanding of it.

15
01:09.090 --> 01:13.080
And then the later part of the course you'll have some more advanced things.

16
01:13.730 --> 01:16.320
So there's a little bit of something for everybody.
