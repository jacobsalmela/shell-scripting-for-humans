00:02.750 --> 00:05.030
So I showed you about these global variables.

1
00:05.600 --> 00:06.250
Let's go.

2
00:06.590 --> 00:11.980
Open the file againand now we're going to make some local variables.

3
00:14.330 --> 00:22.690
So let's say 'local'--so you can only use this local keyword inside of the inside of a function--and we'll

4
00:22.700 --> 00:26.150
make this lower case so we can tell that it's just a local variable.

5
00:26.750 --> 00:28.690
Now set that to 2.0.

6
00:37.750 --> 00:47.790
And then...
[Halo-like announcer] vim-pressive! 
...there we go, we'll use that same thing.

7
00:54.650 --> 01:02.840
So now we've got the same version, we're printing the global variable here and the local one, and

8
01:02.840 --> 01:04.880
then we're doing the same thing outside the function.

9
01:06.200 --> 01:07.540
So let's see how that runs.

10
01:16.600 --> 01:24.420
All right, so the global variable is 1.0 and still inside the function is 2.0.

11
01:25.990 --> 01:29.230
When we're outside of the function, we can still be this global variable.

12
01:30.070 --> 01:31.020
But there's the key:

13
01:31.630 --> 01:35.170
If you're outside the function, you can't read of what the local variables are.

14
01:36.550 --> 01:41.570
So that's actually kind of nice if you want to reuse--let's look at it quick.

15
01:43.220 --> 01:48.040
So if you want to reuse this variable name inside of a different function, you can.

16
01:49.150 --> 01:53.440
So that's the that's how you can use variable scope.

17
01:53.660 --> 01:55.300
And those are local variables.
