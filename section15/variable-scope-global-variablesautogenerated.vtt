So here's our version script, and I'm going to show you about variable scope right now.

1
00:10.230 --> 00:14.040
So first tell you about global variables.

2
00:15.660 --> 00:23.550
So this right now is a global variable because it's not inside of a function and it's usually a good

3
00:23.550 --> 00:27.510
practice in your scripts to just make these capitalized--then you can--

4
00:28.140 --> 00:29.070
at least that's what I do.

5
00:29.070 --> 00:31.070
I make them all capital so I know they're global.

6
00:34.050 --> 00:38.850
And then you can use them inside the function because they're available globally.

7
00:48.930 --> 00:57.780
Add a little statement here inside the function--this is just so you can illustrate what's going on

8
00:58.140 --> 00:59.110
with the scope.

9
01:02.350 --> 01:07.210
So '\$VERSION is $VERSION' and then it will exit.

10
01:17.030 --> 01:18.590
[To self] Take off this 'exit' for now...

11
01:22.700 --> 01:23.290
Let's say...

12
01:29.680 --> 01:36.220
'\$VERSION is $VERSION'. So we have an echo statement that's inside the function and one that's outside the

13
01:36.220 --> 01:36.670
function.

14
01:38.500 --> 01:40.180
Let's just put that up here, too.

15
01:51.400 --> 01:53.080
OK, save that and run that.

16
01:58.190 --> 02:02.120
All right, so inside the function version is '1.0' and outside.

17
02:02.450 --> 02:04.550
That's because this is a global variable.

18
02:06.300 --> 02:09.770
We have access to this variable, whether you're in the function or not.

19
02:14.380 --> 02:16.930
So next, I'm going to show you about local variables.
