So now that you know how to write a script in vim, make it executable with chmod, and run it,

1
00:10.110 --> 00:21.210
you can practice that whole workflow by making a brand new script.  So I'm just gonna' clear my screen here

2
00:22.140 --> 00:24.150
and I want you to make a new script called debug.sh. So do 'vim debug.sh', press "i" once for Insert Mode,

3
00:25.980 --> 00:31.560
Write your shebang,
[Musical singing] She-baaaang!
Add a comment,

4
00:33.460 --> 00:41.200
'this adds debug output to this script'

5
00:42.460 --> 00:49.360
and now here's a new command: 'set -x' the 'set' command lets you set all sorts of different--you know-options and things you can do for your terminal

6
00:49.360 --> 00:56.650
this 'x' basically turns on debug mode so you can see more output from your script when it runs.

7
00:56.950 --> 00:58.000
Then type 'echo i can debug my script now'

8
00:58.870 --> 01:01.300
Press escape once, type ":wq", type 'chmod 755 debug.sh',

9
01:02.890 --> 01:04.690
And then type './debug.sh'

10
01:04.810 --> 01:08.720
So now when you ran your script with that 'set -x', basically every line that's in your script will

11
01:09.190 --> 01:10.630
print the line of code that you wrote and then it's output as well.

12
01:11.110 --> 01:15.870
So this little '+' here, is the line of code that's being run and then this is the actual output from it.

13
01:17.500 --> 01:24.760
So that's just a nice way to get--to get the debug output onto your script.

14
01:24.760 --> 01:25.930
So practice this once more.  Just type 'debug2.sh' this time, 'vim debug2.sh', "i" for Insert Mode,

15
01:26.650 --> 01:28.810
#!/bin/bash, a comment, 'set -x'

16
01:29.890 --> 01:31.660
'echo debugging some more'
'echo debugging another line'

17
01:32.080 --> 01:36.700
Escape, ":wq", 'chmod 755 debug2.sh', './debug2.sh'

18
01:36.700 --> 01:40.030
Mostly that was just so you can get some more practice doing this workflow

19
01:40.480 --> 01:46.610
The 'vim', the 'chmod', and then the './' to run your script.
