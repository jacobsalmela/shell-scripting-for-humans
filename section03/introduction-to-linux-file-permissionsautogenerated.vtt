All right, so you've already seen how to look at file permissions with the 'ls -l' command, but

1
00:10.550 --> 00:11.510
here's what you need to know:

2
00:12.140 --> 00:21.350
Each file has a user and a group, and each file has three sets of permissions: read, write and execute.

3
00:23.270 --> 00:26.790
And then each file has three instances of these permissions.

4
00:27.230 --> 00:29.130
So this is the first instance here.

5
00:30.170 --> 00:31.340
This is the second one.

6
00:31.890 --> 00:32.900
And that's the third.

7
00:33.140 --> 00:40.130
So if you're looking at the output of 'ls'--or 'ls -l', the first character determines what type

8
00:40.130 --> 00:45.440
of file it is--
and here, I'm going to zoom this up so you can see this a little better..

9
00:47.700 --> 00:53.580
So this first first little dash, if it's just a dash, that means it's a file.

10
00:54.540 --> 00:58.050
This might also be the letter "d", which would mean it's a directory.

11
00:59.580 --> 01:02.280
And then there's three sets of permissions.

12
01:04.170 --> 01:06.900
Here's the first one second one.

13
01:07.380 --> 01:07.930
Third one.

14
01:09.000 --> 01:13.710
So this stands for the user's permissions.

15
01:18.100 --> 01:22.480
This one stands for the staff's permission (the group).

16
01:24.570 --> 01:33.120
So these are--goku here has read/write permissions, but the staff group only has read, and then this

17
01:33.120 --> 01:36.600
last set of permissions is for everybody else.

18
01:41.390 --> 01:48.050
So it looks kind of cryptic, this whole little line here, but it's actually pretty straightforward.

19
01:48.060 --> 01:55.790
There's three permissions and three instances of the permissions for users, groups and then everybody else.

20
01:55.790 --> 02:00.860
[musical jingle/signing] user group or other read, write, execute!

21
02:02.410 --> 02:08.890
Now that you've seen that little intro, I think we should run your script so you can actually see the

22
02:08.890 --> 02:10.030
results of your work.
