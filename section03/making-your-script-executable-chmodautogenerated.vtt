OK, you're almost there, you get to make your script executable and then you're going to run it.

1
00:10.110 --> 00:21.210
So just type this 'chmod 755', 
[quircky music/singing ]chmod seven five five!
and the name of your script.

2
00:22.140 --> 00:24.150
'second_script'.sh

3
00:25.980 --> 00:31.560
And press enter.  Now hit the up arrow type or type 'ls -l' again.

4
00:33.460 --> 00:41.200
And now you'll see the permissions on our file have changed, so before it was read/write, read, read,

5
00:42.460 --> 00:49.360
and now let's read/write/execute, read/execute, read/execute. This might seem kind of weird, but basically

6
00:49.360 --> 00:56.650
now that now that this has the executable permission on it, you can just type the name of your script

7
00:56.950 --> 00:58.000
and it will run.

8
00:58.870 --> 01:01.300
So what did that chmod command actually do?

9
01:02.890 --> 01:04.690
It changed the mode.

10
01:04.810 --> 01:08.720
That's what the command stands for, change mode.

11
01:09.190 --> 01:10.630
And then we gave it this number.

12
01:11.110 --> 01:15.870
And these numbers actually relate to what these letters turn out to be.

13
01:17.500 --> 01:24.760
So most most Linux users will be able to actually look at this number and see what the permissions are

14
01:24.760 --> 01:25.930
just based on this number.

15
01:26.650 --> 01:28.810
And maybe you'll get to that point, too.

16
01:29.890 --> 01:31.660
But you don't have to know that for right now.

17
01:32.080 --> 01:36.700
Just remember that this is the command you'll want to run for an any shell script

18
01:36.700 --> 01:40.030
you make: 'chmod 755' and then your script name.

19
01:40.480 --> 01:46.610
So here's a summary of basically what you need to do to create any script.
(to self) reset..

20
01:47.860 --> 01:50.710
You need to type 'vim yourscript.sh ',

21
01:51.310 --> 01:57.580
type "i" for Insert Mode, write some code,

22
02:01.440 --> 02:09.620
escape key, ":wq"--you can actually combine those two, write, and quit at the same time and then

23
02:09.630 --> 02:10.220
'chmod 755

24
02:12.930 --> 02:14.730
yourscript.sh'

25
02:16.290 --> 02:21.030
So that's what you need to do in order to make your script executable and ready to go.

26
02:23.100 --> 02:28.740
So in the next lecture, I'm going to give you a quick overview of Linux file permissions so you can

27
02:28.740 --> 02:34.220
actually understand why--or how this number relates to the file permissions.

28
02:34.500 --> 02:36.690
And then after that, you'll finally get to run your script.
