All right, well, you made it to the lecture where lots of fun things are going to happen, but in

1
00:08.530 --> 00:12.670
exchange for some of this fun, you'll have to think a little bit because I've added some quizzes to

2
00:12.670 --> 00:16.050
the section based on the previous lectures.

3
00:16.810 --> 00:22.260
So let's start off with 'vim' and Insert Mode and Command Mode.

4
00:23.230 --> 00:25.000
So if I just vim a file.

5
00:29.310 --> 00:39.590
And then I'm in Command Mode right now, so I can do ":help" and get help this way in vim, but type ":help"

6
00:39.600 --> 00:40.390
42"

7
00:43.320 --> 00:47.220
And then this will bring up something interesting you can look at and read about.
