So you actually know what commands are ready.

1
00:05.300 --> 00:10.560
Things like, say, echo, grep, vim.

2
00:10.590 --> 00:14.340
Those are all commands and they're the first thing you type 

3
00:14.340 --> 00:16.320
when you're going to want to run something.

4
00:16.590 --> 00:21.150
And each command is a program that does one thing and it does it very well.
