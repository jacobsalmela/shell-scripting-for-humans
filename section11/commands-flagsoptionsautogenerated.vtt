All right, so you've actually also seen these things called flags or options every time you type 'ls -l'

1
00:10.170 --> 00:13.230
that '-l' is one of the flags.

2
00:14.310 --> 00:21.750
So you can type 'ls -lh' and you will see the file sizes will be like a more human-readable format.

3
00:22.650 --> 00:24.570
So they're in kilobytes or bytes.

4
00:25.900 --> 00:29.200
Remember that 'ls' had all these--

5
00:29.430 --> 00:34.830
these are all different options or flags that you can pass to make it do different things.

6
00:34.830 --> 00:41.180
You can make it in show colors, sizes, whatever--whatever else all these options do.

7
00:42.210 --> 00:46.740
But using flags are great because they help modify the behavior of the command.
