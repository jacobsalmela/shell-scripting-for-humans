You may have you may have heard me use this term "arguments" as you've gone through the course and argument

1
00:09.310 --> 00:14.170
is what you write after the command name: 'ls /tmp'.

2
00:14.170 --> 00:17.140
So '/tmp' is the argument to the 'ls' command.

3
00:18.900 --> 00:32.340
The mv command has two arguments: a source file, and a dest file. So that command two arguments.

4
00:33.900 --> 00:38.760
So most commands will take arguments so that you can actually reuse the command, but just do something

5
00:38.760 --> 00:39.270
different.

6
00:39.570 --> 00:45.810
So like you want to use mv, but every time you use it, you want to do something different with the--

7
00:45.990 --> 00:47.160
the files are going to be different.

8
00:47.670 --> 00:51.660
So that's where arguments can come and work nicely with the commands.
