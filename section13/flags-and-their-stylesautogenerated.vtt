So now that you learned about commands and arguments, let's talk about flags and their different styles.

1
00:10.430 --> 00:19.550
So there's the shorthand, which is like just minus and then a letter, this is called POSIX.

2
00:21.610 --> 00:30.490
And then there's a '--long-style', which is usually a full word that you can understand, so

3
00:30.490 --> 00:41.440
either types of these flags or fine, so like 'git'--'git's help option has, you know, --no-pager options,

4
00:41.440 --> 00:43.640
--no-replace-objects there.

5
00:44.140 --> 00:47.350
Those are all human readable words that you can use.

6
00:48.250 --> 00:51.820
But then they've also got these shorter, POSIX-style ones.

7
00:51.940 --> 00:56.050
So you just do you just pass out a letter and then something else.

8
00:56.080 --> 01:02.340
Sometimes it's just only a letter or in this example, you can use either the -p or the --paginate.

9
01:04.960 --> 01:11.020
So it's--it's usually up to the developer how to implement these flags, but at a bare minimum, you

10
01:11.020 --> 01:13.560
should do you should at least do the lowercase letters.

11
01:14.740 --> 01:20.170
And then a lot of programs, newer programs these days will have both options available.
