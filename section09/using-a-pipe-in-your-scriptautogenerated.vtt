All right, so let's implement this pipe character into your lowercase renaming script.

1
00:12.150 --> 00:14.540
So let's just echo out the file name

2
00:18.050 --> 00:23.090
and then do the pipe into this 'tr' command, "translate".

3
00:26.900 --> 00:31.730
And we want all the capital letters, A to Z.

4
00:33.020 --> 00:36.980
We want to translate those into lowercase.

5
00:40.140 --> 00:46.520
And then escape, ":wq".  So let's run that and see if that works.

6
00:47.220 --> 00:48.090
Yep, perfect.

7
00:50.130 --> 00:50.610
So if you do

8
00:50.730 --> 00:52.470
'ls'

9
00:52.770 --> 00:55.590
It just renamed all those to--well it wouldn't rename them;

10
00:55.590 --> 00:56.460
We just echoed it.

11
00:57.540 --> 01:03.770
So now that we can do that, it's pretty trivial to change that.

12
01:05.100 --> 01:14.580
We're just going to make this a new variable:  'newname='
and then we'll put it in '$()'

13
01:15.810 --> 01:29.550
to save that command output, STDOUT', into the variable and 'mv' the existing file name, '$f', to make '$newname'

14
01:31.330 --> 01:32.820
Escape, ":wq"

15
01:35.370 --> 01:41.790
So let's clear the screen and see if we can do this--'ls -l IMG*'.

16
01:42.870 --> 01:45.870
So there's all our capital file names there.

17
01:47.870 --> 01:52.460
Run the lowercase script. Do it again.

18
01:54.010 --> 02:01.990
Yep, and that's good, and there they're all lowercase.  So you just use the pipe character.

19
02:02.530 --> 02:03.670
Let's look at the script again.

20
02:08.800 --> 02:16.330
So here's what you did: you created a new variable named 'newname' because we wanted wanted to have

21
02:16.330 --> 02:19.810
something to rename our files to.

22
02:21.010 --> 02:25.140
So we 'echo'd the current file name, which was all caps.

23
02:25.150 --> 02:33.490
And then we piped it to this 'tr' command and we said "search for all the A to Z capital letters

24
02:33.640 --> 02:36.640
and replace those with lowercase letters."

25
02:37.340 --> 02:43.630
And then since that new file name was saved in the variables, we could just rename it.

26
02:43.630 --> 02:50.050
We said mv--or rename--the existing file to the lowercase one.
