So 'awk' is another useful command to use with the pipe.

1
00:13.940 --> 00:20.300
You can basically use it to--when you have different columns of text that you're working with, so like

2
00:20.300 --> 00:24.410
'ls -l' has this column, this column, this column.

3
00:26.120 --> 00:34.520
You can pipe it into 'awk', and let's say we only wanted to print the file permissions of these folders.

4
00:36.650 --> 00:41.020
You can do that: '{print $1}'

5
00:44.760 --> 00:45.670
Oops, I forgot the 'awk'

6
00:52.150 --> 00:58.570
So there now you just printed only that first column, you could do the same with the second column

7
00:58.570 --> 01:04.270
if you wanted those are all 1's; or the users of all them

8
01:07.750 --> 01:08.470
and this

9
01:10.100 --> 01:15.260
column might be useful to see, but there's this "total"  word that got stuck in there.

10
01:16.340 --> 01:18.590
You can actually fix that with just another pipe.

11
01:20.030 --> 01:26.770
You can use this 'grep' command and search for everything except total.

12
01:26.840 --> 01:28.580
That's what the '-v' flag does.

13
01:29.870 --> 01:30.800
And then there, it's gone.

14
01:32.100 --> 01:37.230
So you can--when you first starting out, you can just, you know, keep piping and piping and

15
01:38.110 --> 01:42.090
different commands until you get just the information that you want.
