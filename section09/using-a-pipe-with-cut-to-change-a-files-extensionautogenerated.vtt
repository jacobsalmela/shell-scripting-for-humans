00:04.420 --> 00:05.770
So let's look at

1
00:08.590 --> 00:10.210
another way you can use pipe.

2
00:15.260 --> 00:18.950
And let's--let's copy this lowercase.sh script and

3
00:20.370 --> 00:21.090
make it

4
00:26.910 --> 00:29.820
change_extension.sh.

5
00:32.940 --> 00:34.410
Let's go edit that.

6
00:38.430 --> 00:41.490
OK, so we're going to change this a bit to say this

7
00:44.460 --> 00:50.100
changes file extensions from py to sh.

8
00:52.830 --> 00:56.730
and that './' is actually going to mess up this next command

9
00:56.760 --> 01:03.450
we're going to do. So I'm going to save the output of a command: print working directory.

10
01:05.100 --> 01:12.480
So this can basically--whatever folder you're in, it'll find all the files in there so we can keep this.

11
01:12.480 --> 01:15.330
If it's a file, we're going to use the 'cut' command.

12
01:15.330 --> 01:22.630
this time. We're going to cut on a delimiter of the period and then the second field.

13
01:24.870 --> 01:28.850
So a file name has a file name, a period, and then an extension.

14
01:30.480 --> 01:37.740
So if we if we were to basically cut that string on the period, you'd want to print the the second

15
01:38.070 --> 01:40.200
thing on the right, which is the file extension.

16
01:41.700 --> 01:43.380
So let's remove that

17
01:47.460 --> 01:50.730
and then we'll just have to echo it out so we can see it

18
01:56.370 --> 01:59.210
Let's print the file name here, too.

19
02:03.060 --> 02:12.930
So let's go to our Documents/ and then run this.  Yup, so that looks right, tccutil.py is py

20
02:12.930 --> 02:15.630
that .tex is tex-- pdf is pdf.

21
02:16.680 --> 02:17.950
So that looks like that's working.

22
02:18.730 --> 02:19.290
So,

23
02:21.870 --> 02:26.760
now, we need to modify this so we can get the exten--we had the extension, but we need the filename

24
02:26.760 --> 02:30.420
as well so we can rename it with a different extension.

25
02:32.460 --> 02:40.620
So let's say "if the extension equals py"

26
02:50.000 --> 02:52.100
'echo changing

27
02:56.090 --> 02:57.680
extension to sh'.

28
03:00.540 --> 03:04.320
And then let's make a new variable, 'fname'.

29
03:06.190 --> 03:14.210
We're basically copy this, but we're going to get fname is equal to that, but this should be 1 instead.

30
03:17.450 --> 03:33.030
And then you can mv the file names that we have, but give it a new name or if $fname.sh.

31
03:38.500 --> 03:39.070
So,

32
03:42.590 --> 03:50.960
so, the--this python file should change to a .sh file with our script.

33
03:53.870 --> 03:57.310
I forgot got to close my 'if' statement here.

34
04:04.850 --> 04:06.620
Yep, so there you saw it changed.

35
04:08.510 --> 04:16.790
And so that worked! So you could basically go through and change any file extension to a different file

36
04:16.790 --> 04:18.650
extension if you wanted with this little script.
