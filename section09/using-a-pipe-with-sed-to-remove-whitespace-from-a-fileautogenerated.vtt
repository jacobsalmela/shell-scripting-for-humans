All right, so let's try another little trick with a pipe.  I'll go over to my documents folder.

1
00:13.730 --> 00:18.400
I'm going to use the 'touch' command to just make a little fake file here.

2
00:20.450 --> 00:26.000
I'm going to do 'filename\ with\ spaces.pdf'

3
00:28.310 --> 00:34.250
So there that showed up there, just the empty file, but you'll notice that I had to put these back

4
00:34.250 --> 00:38.660
slashes in there because the space is actually a special character.

5
00:39.620 --> 00:46.130
So that's--you'll see a lot of Linux file names without spaces because of that very reason.

6
00:47.030 --> 00:53.900
So if we had a big folder with a bunch of these file names or spaces, you might want to go in and try

7
00:53.900 --> 00:56.530
to rename them all with underscores instead.

8
00:58.100 --> 01:00.320
So you can do that.

9
01:03.160 --> 01:05.650
So we're just going to say 'echo filename\ with\ spaces.pdf'.

10
01:06.820 --> 01:07.480
There it is.

11
01:07.690 --> 01:09.250
But if you pipe it to 'sed'.

12
01:13.770 --> 01:21.210
You can do this little trick, so you'd say "search for any spaces" and then what you want to replace it

13
01:21.210 --> 01:23.040
which is a slash

14
01:24.240 --> 01:25.020
or an underscore.

15
01:25.670 --> 01:30.270
So what's what's in between each of these slashes is what you're searching for, what you're going to

16
01:30.270 --> 01:37.020
replace it with, and then if you do a 'g' that just says globally--so do it for every space that you

17
01:37.020 --> 01:37.530
find.

18
01:39.980 --> 01:40.550
There you go.

19
01:40.700 --> 01:42.050
Now it's got underscores

20
01:43.100 --> 01:48.370
You could rename all those files and just rename them with underscores.
