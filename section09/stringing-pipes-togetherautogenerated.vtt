Remember when we did this echo?  We piped this into 'rev' and then we just kept doing that: 'rev', 'rev'...

1
00:14.180 --> 00:20.390
So the more pipes you have here, this is basically opening a whole new another shell to run all these

2
00:20.390 --> 00:21.020
commands.

3
00:22.040 --> 00:25.280
So it's really not a problem when you're doing small datasets like this.

4
00:25.280 --> 00:31.190
but as I mentioned, if you do if you get like a huge text file, you're trying to parse through and

5
00:31.190 --> 00:34.070
do stuff that can slow things down a bit.

6
00:34.080 --> 00:36.990
But really, when you're starting out, you won't have to worry about that at all.

7
00:37.880 --> 00:43.580
And it's actually a really nice way to learn because you can just start trimming down a bunch of text

8
00:43.580 --> 00:49.400
using a bunch of these different commands like the the grep the cuts, the awk's and the sed's.

9
00:49.580 --> 00:53.480
So you can just keep p iping until you get the output that you're looking for.

10
00:55.040 --> 00:57.590
So pipes are pretty cool and they can do some nice things.
