STDIN and STDOUT. Two terms that you'll come to know. [musical singing] "Standard in and standard out" 
it's just

1
00:16.090 --> 00:20.530
a term for the input to a command and the output a command generates.

2
00:21.160 --> 00:23.390
But this is how the pipes work.

3
00:24.640 --> 00:37.600
So in this Dracula example, the STDOUT was this--was 'alucard' and then you pipe it to the STDIN

4
00:37.600 --> 00:39.790
of the 'rev' command.

5
00:40.030 --> 00:45.550
So basically this pipe character is temporarily holding the STDOUT so we can use it with this

6
00:46.160 --> 00:47.230
command that follows.

7
00:48.490 --> 00:52.630
So normally STDIN for this 'rev' command was a file name.

8
00:54.520 --> 00:58.210
So you can't actually just pass it any sort of text you want.

9
00:58.450 --> 01:04.660
You have to have that pipe character there so you can't just make up some text and go in to 'rev'.

10
01:06.370 --> 01:11.080
It just won't work because it'll think you're trying to run this command.

11
01:12.460 --> 01:16.750
And then in the next lecture, I'm going to show you some commands that work well with pipes.
