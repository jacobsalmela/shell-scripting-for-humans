Your scripts will start to grow more complex and evolve.

1
00:04.470 --> 00:10.830
You probably want to be able to call them just by their name and not having to type './version.sh',

2
00:11.640 --> 00:12.640
because that's kind of annoying.

3
00:13.650 --> 00:20.190
So we sort of did this with when you made the function, your .bash_profile or .bashrc.

4
00:21.600 --> 00:23.250
So we just have it as a function.

5
00:24.930 --> 00:31.920
But putting an entire script into this file isn't really going to scale that well either.

6
00:33.390 --> 00:38.950
So it would be nice if we could have our script just be callable by name.

7
00:39.120 --> 00:40.710
So there's a couple of ways to do that.

8
00:41.730 --> 00:42.570
You don't need this--

9
00:42.930 --> 00:44.870
you don't need that .sh on there.

10
00:45.090 --> 00:51.570
So let's 'cp version.sh' and just call it...

11
00:52.440 --> 00:55.710
ka-me-ha

12
00:55.710 --> 00:56.310
me-ha!

13
01:01.680 --> 01:08.720
So you can actually run that and it runs just the same because we have our shebang in there.

14
01:11.850 --> 01:20.610
And then if you remember, a lot of these programs are here in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.

15
01:23.960 --> 01:29.630
But most of your homegrown files or scripts, you'll probably want to install them here.

16
01:31.250 --> 01:35.690
So if you 'mv kamehameha' into

17
01:38.480 --> 01:39.200
/usr/local/bin

18
01:42.020 --> 01:44.240
Then you can just type it.

19
01:48.430 --> 01:51.160
And there it runs just like it would any other command.

20
01:53.440 --> 01:56.680
So let's actually move it back and I'll show you one other way that you can do this.

21
01:57.280 --> 02:00.600
It's just as valid, but it's just another way to do it.

22
02:05.170 --> 02:06.490
So I'll mv that back here

23
02:10.150 --> 02:10.690
There it is.

24
02:12.430 --> 02:22.240
So this this method depends on this variable here, so $PATH so this $PATH--this $PATH variable tells

25
02:23.120 --> 02:26.810
your shell where to find all the commands that are available to you.

26
02:27.160 --> 02:28.900
So here's all the normal spots.

27
02:28.900 --> 02:30.580
/usr/bin, /usr/local/bin

28
02:31.690 --> 02:33.700
And then I got all these other ones on here.

29
02:35.230 --> 02:45.340
So if you do--you can modify this variable, set it equal to the current path, and then put '~'

30
02:45.340 --> 03:00.520
in here and you can still run it, because now if you look at your path again, it'll look for any programs--

31
03:00.520 --> 03:03.060
executable programs in your home folder.

32
03:04.000 --> 03:06.280
So you probably don't usually want to do that.

33
03:06.470 --> 03:11.830
You'd probably want to have like a--a ~/bin folder in your home folder if you were going to do that.

34
03:14.320 --> 03:20.230
But that's just two methods you can do to actually just have your commands run like a real command and

35
03:20.230 --> 03:27.910
not having to do ./scriptname.sh.
So just gives it a little bit more of that professional

36
03:27.910 --> 03:28.390
feel.
