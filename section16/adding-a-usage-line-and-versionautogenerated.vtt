00:03.240 --> 00:09.900
All right, so our script is going to start to grow now, so let's give it a usage line so people know

1
00:09.900 --> 00:15.400
how to use it because we have a lot to--let's copy it first.

2
00:16.470 --> 00:20.190
Let's make a script called usage.sh.

3
00:26.270 --> 00:26.840
And then--

4
00:30.650 --> 00:33.640
so right now, we're just calling these, but that's OK.

5
00:39.100 --> 00:44.050
So let's say 'anything below this line with a'

6
00:52.620 --> 00:55.960
#/ will show up in the usage line

7
01:00.040 --> 01:13.190
So I'll add a comment with a slash, and say 'Usage:' this is 'usage.sh' and we to have a '--help' flag

8
01:13.240 --> 01:14.440
to show our usage

9
01:17.830 --> 01:18.670
and that's optional;

10
01:18.680 --> 01:19.540
we don't need it.

11
01:22.570 --> 01:32.110
And then we're also going to have a version.  It's also nice to just put, you know, a one line

12
01:32.110 --> 01:33.880
sentence about what the thing does.

13
01:36.100 --> 01:36.290
A command

14
01:36.360 --> 01:37.780
line script that does something.

15
01:48.840 --> 01:57.300
But now we need an actual way, a function to convert these style comments into a--

16
01:59.570 --> 02:03.790
into a--something they can print out on the screen, because since these are comments, they're not going

17
02:03.790 --> 02:11.320
to print, but we can use some little special magic using grep here.  So you can do a function called

18
02:11.320 --> 02:12.070
usage.

19
02:13.960 --> 02:17.770
Get your brackets there and then do 'grep'

20
02:21.610 --> 02:24.160
Yeah, this the carrot, the carrot pointing up.

21
02:25.300 --> 02:26.440
So that says:

22
02:28.630 --> 02:38.160
"At the start of the line, look for things that start with #/", and that's our little regex

23
02:38.170 --> 02:38.520
thing.

24
02:40.240 --> 02:44.110
$0--and that's the running script--

25
02:44.740 --> 02:50.470
our script. 'cut' characters, 4

26
02:52.730 --> 02:53.510
So one.

27
02:54.910 --> 02:57.040
One, two, three, four.

28
03:00.040 --> 03:06.250
So this will start at this letter here, the fourth character, and print everything after it.

29
03:10.590 --> 03:12.660
So write that and then.

30
03:17.300 --> 03:20.500
But yeah, so are things still, isn't there?

31
03:22.710 --> 03:26.840
So it's running stuff, but it's not actually showing our help menu.

32
03:29.590 --> 03:34.540
Ahh, that's because we need another little command that will do that for you.

33
03:35.920 --> 03:42.490
So let's add that in here and let's get rid of this because we don't actually want to see that.

34
03:44.560 --> 03:48.730
But we do want to see our usage line if somebody passes --help.

35
03:50.380 --> 03:53.560
So this is just a slick little way to do this.

36
03:54.530 --> 03:56.190
We use this expr command.

37
03:57.280 --> 04:02.530
And remember, this is all the arguments as a space delimited list.

38
04:04.720 --> 04:11.810
And if it starts with--if the flag--one of those flags is '--version'...

39
04:16.210 --> 04:17.950
this thing, I haven't quite shown you yet:

40
04:17.950 --> 04:27.640
but this will basically just send the output of this expression command into this little special file,

41
04:28.330 --> 04:29.620
which makes it be silent.

42
04:31.420 --> 04:41.320
So if this command was successful and we don't see the output, we want to run our usage function,

43
04:42.550 --> 04:47.740
which will print all of this, minus these comment characters.

44
04:52.210 --> 04:55.870
So now if we run usage--and actually...

45
05:02.170 --> 05:05.530
so I should just be able to run 'usage.sh' here...yep!

46
05:10.290 --> 05:11.550
So if I pass '--help',

47
05:18.670 --> 05:20.340
And actually our thing is,

48
05:23.520 --> 05:27.450
we want to get rid of that because we're not too concerned about the first argument right now.

49
05:35.700 --> 05:38.430
Fail.

50
05:44.350 --> 05:44.860
There we go.

51
05:45.760 --> 05:56.270
And we got our usage. So if we look at the script, you see it printed these lines here minus the--the

52
05:56.470 --> 05:57.190
comments.

53
06:01.420 --> 06:07.870
So we actually did--do need that version back in there, too. So let's just add both of those.

54
06:14.560 --> 06:18.070
So if they pass '--version' we'll run the version function.
