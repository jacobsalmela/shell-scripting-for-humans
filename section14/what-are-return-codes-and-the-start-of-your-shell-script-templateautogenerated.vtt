Well, you've made it this far in the course.

1
00:04.760 --> 00:09.770
So now I'm going to teach you about return codes and then you're going to start writing your own program.

2
00:11.030 --> 00:16.340
And this will be basically a template script that you can take anywhere and make whatever sort of program

3
00:16.340 --> 00:16.780
you want.

4
00:17.870 --> 00:22.070
But I want to teach you about these return codes first, because they serve an important purpose and

5
00:22.070 --> 00:24.950
are often underused when people write scripts.

6
00:27.290 --> 00:34.370
So if you do a 'ls --help'... remember, this is the thing that gives an error option.

7
00:37.740 --> 00:45.480
Then you can type 'echo' this special variable here, 'echo $?' that will give you the

8
00:45.480 --> 00:48.960
return code of the last command that ran.

9
00:50.280 --> 00:56.100
So here it was one.  That--and in general terms, a zero--

10
00:56.490 --> 01:00.510
if it's a 0 return code, it means the program was successful.

11
01:01.320 --> 01:07.020
If it was a 1, that means something went wrong or basically anything that's not a zero means something

12
01:07.020 --> 01:07.550
went wrong.

13
01:08.910 --> 01:11.970
So if you type 'ls'...that one worked.

14
01:12.450 --> 01:18.140
Check it again, the return code is 0 because it printed it off properly.

15
01:21.110 --> 01:27.020
So basically, you're going to want to try to do the same thing in your script, so if you know something

16
01:27.020 --> 01:28.700
might error or..

17
01:29.910 --> 01:31.150
not work properly,

18
01:31.920 --> 01:33.660
put a little return code in there.

19
01:34.350 --> 01:41.820
So then other users--if they check this, they'll know whether or not your command--your script executed

20
01:41.820 --> 01:42.860
correctly or not.
