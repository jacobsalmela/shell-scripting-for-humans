00:02.630 --> 00:10.700
So you already saw this '$?' syntax: this is a special variable that will show

1
00:10.700 --> 00:17.330
you the return code of the last command.  But there's something important you should know about it.

2
00:17.330 --> 00:18.950
It's only the last command.

3
00:20.830 --> 00:26.990
So if you echo that out, it's going to be 1 because it was it did not function properly.

4
00:28.280 --> 00:33.740
But if you run it again, it's going to be a zero because it's only for the last command.

5
00:34.730 --> 00:40.810
So your last command here was an echo command, which worked just fine because it printed that out.

6
00:41.660 --> 00:45.010
So then when you run that command again, it's going to be a 0 .

7
00:46.250 --> 00:55.250
So just something to note that this special variable will only hold the return code for the last command

8
00:55.280 --> 00:55.940
that was run.
