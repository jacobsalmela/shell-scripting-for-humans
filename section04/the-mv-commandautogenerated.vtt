All right, so the mv command lets you move a file to a new location.

1
00:06.590 --> 00:13.460
It's also the main program used to rename files and folders, and a lot of times you'll do that in the

2
00:13.460 --> 00:14.450
same command.

3
00:14.810 --> 00:16.400
So here's an example.

4
00:17.540 --> 00:23.870
Going to /tmp, just make a random file or something.

5
00:26.480 --> 00:27.430
See if it's there.

6
00:27.590 --> 00:28.280
There it is.

7
00:29.630 --> 00:31.940
Now you can say 'mv something

8
00:34.490 --> 00:40.550
stuff_and_things',.  See?  Now it's named stuff_and_things.

9
00:42.810 --> 00:46.270
And so you can actually do that in the same same command.

10
00:46.290 --> 00:49.260
You can move it and rename it to a totally different spot.

11
00:50.760 --> 00:59.370
So let's move stuff_and_things to '~/', which is a shorthand for your home folder.

12
01:01.570 --> 01:10.000
Say...my_moved_file.  We can go back with 'cd -' to my home folder, because that was the last folder

13
01:10.000 --> 01:10.690
that I was in.

14
01:12.270 --> 01:14.020
And then there's my moved file.

15
01:17.890 --> 01:20.700
And there it has the "something" in it that I originally put in there.
