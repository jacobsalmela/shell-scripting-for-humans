If you can remember your workflow for writing a script, 'vim' we're going to name our script just 'cd'

1
00:10.530 --> 00:18.780
We don't do the '.sh' here just and you'll see why.  Type "i" for Insert, type your shebang

2
00:23.040 --> 00:23.880
and a comment.

3
00:25.190 --> 00:31.770
'this will change directories and list what's in them'

4
00:34.050 --> 00:38.320
So add this in here: 'builtin cd'

5
00:38.940 --> 00:41.640
This is saying use a built in cd command

6
00:46.740 --> 00:48.000
'$*'

7
00:49.560 --> 00:53.100
I'll explain that in a little while, '&&'

8
00:55.290 --> 01:04.470
'ls'.  So this is our file browser script; we're just writing it in one line and then type escape

9
01:06.360 --> 01:07.800
":wq"

10
01:10.260 --> 01:11.150
'chmod'

11
01:13.560 --> 01:15.710
'755 cd'

12
01:19.640 --> 01:20.700
And that's it.

13
01:20.990 --> 01:26.810
So you just wrote a shell script and automated something at the same time, so let's try using your

14
01:26.870 --> 01:27.530
new script.

15
01:27.650 --> 01:32.690
So let's do './cd' and we'll go into /tmp

16
01:33.890 --> 01:34.820
Well, look at that.

17
01:35.720 --> 01:37.040
You just automated it.

18
01:37.310 --> 01:37.970
You...

19
01:39.540 --> 01:43.480
changed directories, and it listed the things for you automatically...pretty cool.

20
01:45.120 --> 01:48.230
So the last part of this section is an assignment.

21
01:48.480 --> 02:02.910
So you're going to navigate into the /usr.. 'cd /usr/bin' and then use 'ls' or 'ls -l' to list

22
02:02.910 --> 02:07.830
through look through some of these commands that are in here and then just try to imagine what some

23
02:07.830 --> 02:11.790
of them might do just based on what they're named.
