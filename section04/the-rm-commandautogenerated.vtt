So the rm command lets you remove files to delete them.

1
00:09.830 --> 00:11.570
So go to /tmp

2
00:19.400 --> 00:23.270
These are just some temporary files that we can get rid of without problem.

3
00:24.740 --> 00:29.270
So if I want to remove a file, I can do 'rm' and then the file name.

4
00:33.630 --> 00:35.000
And there you see it disappeared,

5
00:39.360 --> 00:46.470
so you can't actually use this against a directory without some extra flags, so you have to do '-r'

6
00:46.470 --> 00:51.990
which means recurse to the directories.  See?  enemies as a directory.

7
00:52.170 --> 00:53.550
That's what this 'd' means.

8
00:57.960 --> 00:58.750
And there it's gone.

9
01:00.030 --> 01:01.800
Same thing over here on Linux.

10
01:07.760 --> 01:09.650
'rm' to delete it then it's gone.

11
01:21.150 --> 01:26.370
There's no dragon balls around.  So the rm command basically lets you just remove files.
