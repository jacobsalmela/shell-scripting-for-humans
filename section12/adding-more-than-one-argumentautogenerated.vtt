00:05.010 --> 00:06.680
So you could do the same thing here.

1
00:11.960 --> 00:12.890
'second_arg=$2'.

2
00:20.690 --> 00:22.430
But we'll just print that out: 'echo...' [typing]

3
00:31.130 --> 00:34.580
So /Users/goku and just whatever.

4
00:36.370 --> 00:38.260
So there it printed out the second argument.

5
00:39.400 --> 00:40.420
So even though it was

6
00:41.390 --> 00:47.660
second, we--the second argument--we just grabbed it and listed it first, and then it went through

7
00:47.660 --> 00:48.790
all the other stuff.

8
00:49.520 --> 00:51.380
So I suggest using that trick.

9
00:53.680 --> 00:59.440
Using these named variables, basically, any time you find yourself using this number one, two, three,

10
00:59.440 --> 01:00.160
four, whatever.

11
01:01.320 --> 01:03.540
Always name them, because then it's easier to keep track of them.
