All right, so the script using this '$1' is pretty--pretty helpful, but if you want to take more arguments

1
00:12.220 --> 00:18.700
like the second or third argument, it starts to get hard to keep track of which argument at which.

2
00:19.750 --> 00:20.940
So this is nice:

3
00:20.950 --> 00:23.500
You can do some named arguments.

4
00:25.300 --> 00:34.330
Let's make a variable here: 'search_dir=$1' and then replace that with '$search_dir'.

5
00:35.320 --> 00:37.240
So those are just called named arguments.

6
00:39.160 --> 00:40.390
So now if we do

7
00:43.400 --> 00:46.630
'/Users' or '/Users/goku'

8
00:49.810 --> 00:50.770
[To self] Forgot a star on here..

9
00:59.030 --> 01:01.010
It lists all the directories in the files.

10
01:03.970 --> 01:07.870
And it's basically the same output, but we use that named directory (argument).
