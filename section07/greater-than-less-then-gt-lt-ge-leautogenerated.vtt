All right, so sometimes you're going to want to compare numbers in your scripts can actually do some

1
00:07.580 --> 00:12.190
simple math, so it's sometimes useful to check if the number meets a certain condition.

2
00:12.470 --> 00:17.090
I'm actually going to write these out on the command line because you remember all these commands you

3
00:17.090 --> 00:18.110
put in your scripts.

4
00:18.110 --> 00:21.110
You can actually just run these right on the command line.

5
00:22.610 --> 00:24.680
So I'm going to show you this.

6
00:24.980 --> 00:26.870
'if [[ 1 -gt 0 ]]'

7
00:30.410 --> 00:34.850
'then; echo greater than'

8
00:35.600 --> 00:35.950
'fi'

9
00:37.790 --> 00:44.840
So I'm doing this all on one line and then I'm using these semicolons to break up the statements, so

10
00:44.840 --> 00:46.100
that's just the easy way to do it.

11
00:46.100 --> 00:48.680
If you're if you want to just try this out on the command line.

12
00:49.430 --> 00:53.380
So you could also just paste this right into your script if you wanted it on one line.

13
00:53.390 --> 00:58.700
But once it's in the script, it's easier, I think, to read it if it's on multiple lines there and

14
01:00.090 --> 01:07.260
you can also do the same for less than...change that.

15
01:08.630 --> 01:09.620
Less than

16
01:13.010 --> 01:13.610
less than.

17
01:15.030 --> 01:16.080
So that was true.

18
01:18.450 --> 01:22.550
You can do greater than or equals.

19
01:34.930 --> 01:43.540
'-ge' greater than or equal to--so that's a nice way you can just test things out and see if they work.
