Well, I think you have enough skills now to make a file-renaming script, so let's just copy the if.sh

1
00:15.040 --> 00:22.570
the script and make one cold rename.sh.  Go edit that...

2
00:26.620 --> 00:30.780
and then just comment: this renames files

3
00:36.550 --> 00:43.690
So with that line, you can press "dd" here to remove the line if you hit escape and then "dd" it will delete

4
00:43.960 --> 00:44.620
the line.

5
00:45.810 --> 00:54.640
I think we just want our if/else statement here, so "i" to go back into Insert

6
00:54.640 --> 01:03.130
Mode, and let's just make one called files.  We'll saveLookThaB the output of the command, 'ls' 

7
01:04.570 --> 01:11.890
The '$files' variable will hold all our files names in there and then we'll see if it is a file,

8
01:16.030 --> 01:16.600
then

9
01:19.990 --> 01:23.740
we can rename it.

10
01:25.810 --> 01:30.340
So I have some image files in here that we can look at.

11
01:36.800 --> 01:46.040
So I've got a bunch of these,,,uh..image files, which maybe you'd have from like a digital camera or whatever,

12
01:48.330 --> 01:49.850
So let's say

13
01:52.220 --> 01:58.510
files--actually, let's just do with just the image files here.

14
01:59.690 --> 02:00.830
So 'IMG*'

15
02:02.080 --> 02:09.400
So that should list all the files and with image, then we can move those files and rename them:

16
02:12.190 --> 02:13.420
'IMG_*'

17
02:16.540 --> 02:26.080
And if it's not a file--or not a file, just echo that it's not and we'll close it.  Escape ":wq"

18
02:27.980 --> 02:34.930
And let's make a directory, 'mkdir', just so we can see what happens if it does run into a directory.

19
02:38.360 --> 02:39.230
"mk-deer"

20
02:41.170 --> 02:43.600
Oops, I think that made it in the wrong spot

21
02:44.110 --> 02:44.530
'mv deer' into 

22
02:48.070 --> 02:48.730
'Pictures/'

23
02:51.030 --> 02:51.500
Here we go.

24
02:53.010 --> 02:54.390
I'm in the Pictures folder

25
02:58.060 --> 02:59.460
'cat' this script here.

26
03:07.550 --> 03:09.830
So here's what we had there.

27
03:12.250 --> 03:17.300
So let's see what's in the '$files'.

28
03:17.800 --> 03:20.290
Perfect, so that lists only your images.

29
03:23.040 --> 03:29.040
So our 'mv' statement here is going to say, "move image and add an underscore to it".

30
03:30.690 --> 03:32.970
So let's try to run our script.

31
03:35.670 --> 03:36.600
"It's not a file."

32
03:41.670 --> 03:47.070
Well, this looks like the perfect opportunity to show you about loops. =)
