You can check with the if statement if the thing you're checking is a file, which is kind of useful.

1
00:15.000 --> 00:19.800
So if cmd_output_vars.sh is a file, then

2
00:22.980 --> 00:25.170
'echo its a file'

3
00:28.870 --> 00:35.830
So if you check that for a directory--remember, '.' is just for the current directory--then nothing happens

4
00:35.830 --> 00:38.620
because it's not in the directory, but you can change

5
00:38.620 --> 00:40.030
that to a "d"

6
00:42.010 --> 00:43.660
Well, that--you should say it's a directory.

7
00:48.050 --> 00:54.050
So those are pretty useful for scripting because sometimes you want to do stuff--you might want to

8
00:54.050 --> 01:04.220
delete only files and not folders or whatever else it may be.  You can also check if variables are empty

9
01:04.220 --> 01:04.760
or not.

10
01:07.040 --> 01:08.000
So if I just--

11
01:10.710 --> 01:13.040
--empty-- so I could just make up a variable name

12
01:17.390 --> 01:17.760
then,

13
01:23.890 --> 01:25.190
'echo its an empty var'

14
01:29.870 --> 01:37.310
But you can check if it's a--'$SHELL' is a variable, I know that has something in it, then that produces

15
01:37.310 --> 01:37.630
nothing.

16
01:39.540 --> 01:50.630
And the opposite of that is if it's a non-zero so if there's something in it, then you say it's--it's

17
01:50.880 --> 01:52.720
a populated var.

18
01:59.720 --> 02:03.260
Same thing, if you did that, then it doesn't work.

19
02:04.250 --> 02:06.190
So those are good ones to know for your script.
