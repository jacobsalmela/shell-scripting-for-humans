So the equals part of the if statement here is called an operator.  So you can check for other things

1
00:10.090 --> 00:15.490
other than just if it's equal; you can check mathematical conditions, you can check if it's a file

2
00:15.640 --> 00:16.600
or if it's a directory,

3
00:16.600 --> 00:22.390
and much more. There's a pretty good list of them on this site, which I have in the notes.

4
00:23.470 --> 00:25.900
And I can never remember them all myself,

5
00:25.900 --> 00:27.580
so I always reference this one.

6
00:27.790 --> 00:36.340
So you can see, like, if it's a file, if the file exists, if it's, uh, the file exists and it's

7
00:36.340 --> 00:45.040
readable.  You can check all sorts of different stuff...if it's modified since it was last read,

8
00:46.570 --> 00:52.110
and then here's some of the other type of things you can do: if the strings are equal, not equal.

9
00:54.280 --> 01:02.800
And then there's all these useful ones for mathematical type stuff: equals, not equals, less than, less

10
01:02.800 --> 01:05.110
than or equal...all that stuff.

11
01:07.140 --> 01:12.420
So I'll just reference this page if you ever want to see which which ones you might be able to use in

12
01:12.420 --> 01:19.140
your script, and then I'm going to cover some of these more common ones like these in the next lecture.
