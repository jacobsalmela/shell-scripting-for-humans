00:03.880 --> 00:06.010
So make one called

1
00:09.160 --> 00:09.820
'detect_os.sh'

2
00:24.870 --> 00:29.070
So to start, I usually do this big 'if' statement

3
00:32.280 --> 00:36.460
'$OSTYPE', it's like a built in variable, so

4
00:43.140 --> 00:45.170
it's easy to test for Linux first.

5
00:52.260 --> 00:54.820
And then the '*' there just checks for different types

6
00:57.550 --> 00:57.960
'then'...

7
01:01.360 --> 01:02.080
'echo Linux detected...'

8
01:08.310 --> 01:10.330
'yy' to copy that line

9
01:13.480 --> 01:17.380
'p' to paste it, and we need a couple of these.

10
01:23.570 --> 01:27.450
And then for the multiples, you can do 'elif', instead of 'else'

11
01:45.950 --> 01:47.690
So there I'm using an exit code since

12
01:48.870 --> 01:55.640
I don't know what the OS is, and actually, let's 'yy' that and

13
02:05.650 --> 02:06.120
So darwin

14
02:08.980 --> 02:11.740
macOS

15
02:16.690 --> 02:17.550
cygwin

16
02:19.820 --> 02:21.550
is basically...

17
02:24.120 --> 02:25.050
POSIX.

18
03:09.440 --> 03:11.450
All right, so there's a little 'if' statement.

19
03:21.510 --> 03:24.840
And there you see I'm on a Mac so that detected that properly.

20
03:26.670 --> 03:27.780
So that's the first part;

21
03:27.790 --> 03:34.680
so I'll usually put that at the start of my script and then it will 'exit' if it's doesn't detect what

22
03:34.680 --> 03:35.160
it is.

23
03:37.020 --> 03:40.200
And then you can also add this 'case' statement

24
03:43.230 --> 03:43.650
So you do....

25
03:47.030 --> 03:48.080
'case $OSTYPE in'

26
03:51.110 --> 03:53.370
then we put the same flavors in here.

27
04:22.940 --> 04:30.430
So here you could put, you know, special variables that you want for each type of system if you're

28
04:30.440 --> 04:32.530
trying to make it as compatible as possible.

29
05:12.340 --> 05:18.510
So there's a nice little script you can use to detect an OS and then do something different with it.
