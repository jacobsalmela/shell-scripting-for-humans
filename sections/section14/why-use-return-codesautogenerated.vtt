All right, so beyond the basic reason of showing whether or not your script to work with these return

1
00:07.140 --> 00:12.900
codes here, it helps other programmers because they'll check for it--check for the exit code.

2
00:13.290 --> 00:19.590
But if your script starts to grow quite complex, you know, you might have--need all sorts of different

3
00:19.590 --> 00:20.360
error codes.

4
00:21.120 --> 00:30.870
So like, if a script fails to copy something, it might be the "failed to copy" might be 1.

5
00:36.160 --> 00:37.030
But if it--

6
00:40.180 --> 00:47.200
if something didn't exist in the first place, that might equal  2.

7
00:50.650 --> 00:55.180
So then if somebody has trouble with your script and you have a bunch of these exit codes, you can

8
00:55.180 --> 01:01.990
tie those to a specific error message and then, you know-- that's basically your documentation.

9
01:01.990 --> 01:06.640
And then if somebody needs help with your script, you can just say, "what was the exit code"?

10
01:07.690 --> 01:11.950
And then you go on--search your script for that code and then you can find out right where they're

11
01:11.950 --> 01:12.790
having a problem.

12
01:13.040 --> 01:17.440
And then if there's a bug to fix, it can be at the right spot.
