I'm going to show you how to make your own return codes now.  Let's actually use that dir_args.sh script,

1
00:09.960 --> 00:17.670
because we already know there's a conditional check in here for if you pass a file, then it gives an

2
00:17.670 --> 00:18.570
error message here.

3
00:20.940 --> 00:23.040
So what we can actually do is do 'exit'--

4
00:23.820 --> 00:27.670
you know, it could be any number you want, really, as long as it's not 0.

5
00:29.140 --> 00:29.430
This--

6
00:30.430 --> 00:36.040
in our code--this means that you can't--we don't want a file here because we're trying to search through

7
00:36.040 --> 00:42.910
a directory, so we give them a helpful error message here and then you give them a return code of your

8
00:42.910 --> 00:43.300
choice.

9
00:43.330 --> 00:47.110
This could be any number--any--'exit 43' if you want.

10
00:51.190 --> 00:53.510
So let's write that and then try to run in here.

11
00:53.530 --> 00:54.580
So if I run it with-- [typing]

12
00:57.860 --> 01:03.630
And I do an ech--check the return code here, that's a 0.

13
01:04.810 --> 01:06.400
But now if I pass it a file...

14
01:10.120 --> 01:10.660
Perfect.

15
01:12.940 --> 01:13.540
So now,

16
01:14.710 --> 01:19.900
that's a perfect way for me to see where in my code the whoever was running the script had a problem.

17
01:21.160 --> 01:23.080
so far to go into my school code.

18
01:23.380 --> 01:31.660
I can do--if you're in Command Mode--this is a way you can search: you can do '/43' and hit enter.

19
01:32.980 --> 01:33.550
Ah, there we go.

20
01:34.000 --> 01:35.290
So this user--

21
01:36.650 --> 01:38.790
Oh, they did not pass--the $search_dir--

22
01:38.800 --> 01:40.210
was a file, that's why.

23
01:41.340 --> 01:46.350
Not really a problem for us, because we already need to account for that, but it's good you can search

24
01:46.350 --> 01:47.610
by the exit code.

25
01:50.580 --> 01:53.940
And that's how you make your own exit codes.
