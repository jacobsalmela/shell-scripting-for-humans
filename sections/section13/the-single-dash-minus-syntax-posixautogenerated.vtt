00:03.080 --> 00:10.460
So when I mentioned you should use this POSIX syntax in your script, this is just a single--single letter

1
00:10.470 --> 00:16.160
ones. The POSIX stands for Portable Operating System Interface.

2
00:17.360 --> 00:22.100
It's basically just a standard for maintaining compatibility between operating systems.

3
00:22.370 --> 00:27.090
So it just makes your script more compatible to run on different places.

4
00:27.350 --> 00:33.200
So remember how you can run a shell script on Linux and macOS because it's running in your shell.

5
00:33.860 --> 00:36.230
So different operating systems will do things differently.

6
00:36.470 --> 00:39.720
So you don't really know where your shell script might run.

7
00:40.700 --> 00:41.990
So it's just a good idea to make

8
00:41.990 --> 00:47.150
it as compatible and resilient as possible by at least adding in those types of flags.
