So there's a long style options--flags, and these are really helpful for humans, especially if you're

1
00:11.810 --> 00:13.490
writing some complex scripts.

2
00:15.020 --> 00:19.100
So you might not be familiar with what every command does.

3
00:23.270 --> 00:26.480
So like, [chuckles] who's going to remember what all those do?

4
00:26.840 --> 00:28.090
Probably not too many people.

5
00:29.060 --> 00:37.940
But if you look at 'rsync' command: look at all these different options, you can do. So this help page is

6
00:37.940 --> 00:39.050
a lot more helpful.

7
00:39.950 --> 00:44.270
And it has these "--style-things".

8
00:44.870 --> 00:51.290
And some of them, you can just find out what it might do based on the word: so --recursive.

9
00:52.280 --> 00:54.650
It tells you here that it's going to recursive directories.

10
00:54.650 --> 01:02.210
But, you know, if you just saw this option in a script, you might know that is trying to go into

11
01:02.210 --> 01:07.070
all the directories as opposed to if you were just using this '-r' .

12
01:15.570 --> 01:17.910
Yeah, so even like this one, '--human-readable'.

13
01:18.480 --> 01:24.120
There you go, if you just had '-h' and someone who's unfamiliar with this 'rsync'  command, they

14
01:24.120 --> 01:28.140
might not know what it is, but "output numbers in human readable format".

15
01:29.430 --> 01:33.990
So it's it's nice to have these, too; especially for writing scripts.

16
01:34.470 --> 01:40.020
And sometimes these 'rsync'; commands will have a whole bunch of different flags set to them to do

17
01:40.020 --> 01:40.680
what you want.

18
01:41.070 --> 01:45.510
So it's nice to just nice in your script to have the option to do both.
