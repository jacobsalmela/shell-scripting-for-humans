So let's look at our directory argument script,

1
00:09.010 --> 00:16.240
The second one doesn't really do anything right now, but what do you do if a user for their search

2
00:16.240 --> 00:17.980
directory passes in a file?

3
00:19.420 --> 00:21.910
Your script is just going to break, right? And is not going to work.

4
00:22.240 --> 00:23.380
So let's try that.

5
00:29.360 --> 00:32.530
[To self] And I think there's a some sort of script in here...

6
00:36.500 --> 00:38.480
we'll give it a file name instead of a folder.

7
00:41.140 --> 00:42.670
So it didn't really do--

8
00:43.120 --> 00:47.500
It didn't error out, it didn't print anything, so it was just kind of weird.

9
00:48.370 --> 00:51.550
This is the actually the first--the second argument that we didn't print.

10
00:57.140 --> 01:02.990
But really, this isn't searching a directory, it's only searching a file.

11
01:04.260 --> 01:08.430
What if you gave it, you know, something that doesn't exist?

12
01:12.880 --> 01:19.690
So you kind of want to try to help the user and give--them instead of handling some bad--just taking

13
01:19.690 --> 01:23.830
in the default input that they give you, you might want to

14
01:25.160 --> 01:28.430
check things first--So a simple check, 

15
01:34.650 --> 01:42.220
we already have a place: if it's a directory or not.  But this should be a little more of a help--

16
01:42.220 --> 01:42.990
helpful message.

17
01:44.110 --> 01:48.900
You want to--you want to be able to give the users some actionable information on what they can do to

18
01:48.900 --> 01:52.080
actually get it to work the way you want it to.

19
01:53.370 --> 01:56.670
So instead of just saying skipping--like--the file, you should say:

20
02:02.370 --> 02:05.730
You can add a little helpful statement here: 'if...

21
02:14.400 --> 02:17.040
Well, if '$search_dir' is a file..

22
02:31.350 --> 02:33.200
So now if you run it again

23
02:37.100 --> 02:37.510
with our.. [typing] 

24
02:42.390 --> 02:47.120
So there: there's some actionable information 'you need to pass a directory for this script'.
