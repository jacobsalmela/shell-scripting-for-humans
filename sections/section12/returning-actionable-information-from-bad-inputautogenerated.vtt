So you as the developer get to--know your script best, so it's up to you to decide what error message

1
00:08.550 --> 00:10.150
you get to show to your user.

2
00:11.460 --> 00:14.580
So in practice, this can actually be a little more challenging.

3
00:15.330 --> 00:17.880
But try to create like a one sentence message.

4
00:19.020 --> 00:27.870
So if a user ran it and ran into this problem, they could look at the last piece of output and determine

5
00:27.870 --> 00:30.900
what to do to get it to work it.

6
00:31.140 --> 00:35.760
And it might seem like a lot of work to do this, but writing good scripts can go a really long way,

7
00:36.030 --> 00:41.220
especially if you're learning this for your work or your job, where your other users are going to be

8
00:41.220 --> 00:42.600
interacting with your scripts.

9
00:44.400 --> 00:45.660
Right now, the script

10
00:48.870 --> 00:58.800
will print all the desk--or the folders--all the folders or the directories. If you pass it a file,

11
01:03.300 --> 01:04.440
tt will give you this error.

12
01:07.580 --> 01:10.790
So let's get rid of this.

13
01:11.000 --> 01:17.330
If you're in Command Mode by pressing escape, you can just do 'dd' to get rid of a line and we can

14
01:17.330 --> 01:19.430
actually keep this in here if we want to use it later, 

15
01:19.700 --> 01:24.260
but we're not actually going to be needing it right now.

16
01:25.760 --> 01:36.470
So we'll keep this, but we'll make this message a little bit more actionable. So you can try to give

17
01:36.470 --> 01:38.690
them an example of what they can do to fix it.

18
01:40.250 --> 01:47.180
So we'll do some command output into a variable here and we'll say '$(dirname..'

19
01:47.650 --> 01:50.450
Remember, we used 'basename' last time to get the file name.

20
01:53.120 --> 01:57.340
So we know they passed us a file so we can take the--

21
01:58.190 --> 02:01.680
[To self] And should my own practice here..'$search_dir'

22
02:03.470 --> 02:10.700
So this will say, "give me the directory name of this file that you passed in" and that will give them

23
02:10.700 --> 02:12.470
a little bit more actionable input.

24
02:14.270 --> 02:18.340
And then this line is just kind of frivolous,

25
02:19.610 --> 02:20.720
so delete that.

26
02:21.710 --> 02:24.140
We don't really care to do anything if it's not a directory.

27
02:24.140 --> 02:29.510
So you can just put that ':' in there--that basically just says "don't do anything".

28
02:31.250 --> 02:32.830
So let's quit and run that again.

29
02:32.840 --> 02:35.740
And that looks a lot better.

30
02:36.920 --> 02:39.080
And what happens if you pass it a file?

31
02:42.340 --> 02:49.480
So there was an actionable message that figured out that lowercase.sh was in this folder and then gave

32
02:49.480 --> 02:51.080
an example of what you can pass.

33
02:51.700 --> 02:55.210
So that worked pretty slick for our directory argument script.
