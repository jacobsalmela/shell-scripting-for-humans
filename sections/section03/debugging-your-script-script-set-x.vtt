So now that you know how to write a script in vim, make it executable with chmod and run it.  You can

1
00:08.720 --> 00:11.550
practice that whole workflow by making a brand new script.

2
00:12.110 --> 00:20.140
So I'm just going to clear my screen here, and I want you to make a new script called debug.sh.

3
00:20.360 --> 00:28.350
So do 'vim debug.sh'.  Press "i" once for Insert Mode. Write your

4
00:28.370 --> 00:40.670
shebang. 
[Musical singing] "Sha-baaaaaang!
Add a comment: 'this adds debug output to the script'

5
00:42.440 --> 00:45.140
Now here's a new command 'set -x'

6
00:45.710 --> 00:54.200
The 'set' command lets you set all sorts of different, you know, options and things you can do for your

7
00:54.200 --> 00:54.700
terminal.

8
00:55.460 --> 01:01.070
This 'x' basically turns on debug mode so you can see more output from your script when it runs.

9
01:02.720 --> 01:17.570
And then type 'echo i can debug my script now'
Press escape once, type ":wq" 
[Upbeat singing] "Colon w q!"

10
01:19.040 --> 01:22.310
'chmod 755 debug.sh'

11
01:28.070 --> 01:30.650
Then type './debug.sh'

12
01:33.510 --> 01:42.690
So now, when you ran your script with that 'set -x', basically every line that's in your script

13
01:42.690 --> 01:48.870
will print the line of code that you wrote and then its output as well.

14
01:49.430 --> 01:55.590
So this little plus here is the line of code that's being run and then this is the actual output from

15
01:55.590 --> 01:55.790
it.

16
01:56.670 --> 02:03.640
So that's just a nice way to get to get the debug output onto your script.

17
02:05.040 --> 02:10.060
So practice this once more, just type 'vim debug2.sh'

18
02:10.090 --> 02:18.930
this time. 'vim debug2.sh'.  "i" for Insert Mode,  '#!/bin/bash'

19
02:22.020 --> 02:22.800
add a comment

20
02:24.750 --> 02:38.070
'set -x', 
'echo debugging some more'
'echo another line'
Escape, ":wq"

21
02:39.970 --> 02:42.520
'chmod 755 debug2.sh'

22
02:44.200 --> 02:47.380
'./debug2.sh'

23
02:48.240 --> 02:53.070
Mostly, that was just so you can get some more practice doing this workflow: the 'vim', the 'chmod'

24
02:53.070 --> 02:55.830
and then './script.sh' to run your script.
