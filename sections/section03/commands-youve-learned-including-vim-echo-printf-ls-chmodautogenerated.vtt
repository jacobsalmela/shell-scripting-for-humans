Much of shell scripting is just learning what commands are available for you to use, and you already

1
00:08.020 --> 00:08.860
know quite a few.

2
00:09.310 --> 00:14.830
I haven't taught you this one directly, but 'clear' clears the screen and each command is essentially

3
00:14.830 --> 00:15.710
an application.

4
00:15.910 --> 00:22.780
So these are just all really small programs that do one thing really well, which is sort of the

5
00:22.780 --> 00:24.000
Linux/Unix philosophy.

6
00:24.610 --> 00:31.270
It's just small programs that do one thing really well and then you can tie them all together to do

7
00:31.270 --> 00:32.680
something different.

8
00:32.920 --> 00:40.000
So, you know, the clear command, you know bash, you know vim, you know ls.

9
00:40.880 --> 00:48.910
cd, rm.  You know, chmod to change mode,

10
00:51.970 --> 00:55.420
pwd and, you know, the set command.

11
00:56.230 --> 01:00.070
So you've already learned quite a few commands just from learning how to write a script.

12
01:00.430 --> 01:05.020
As we continue on through the lectures, you're going to learn more and more commands and you'll add

13
01:05.020 --> 01:11.050
those to your knowledge and then you just start plugging the commands together to make a script to do

14
01:11.050 --> 01:11.830
what you want to do.
