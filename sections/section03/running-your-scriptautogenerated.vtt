Well, nice work and making it this far, you get to actually write your script now!  So if you type

1
00:08.900 --> 00:18.140
'./' and then the name of your script, 'second_script.sh', it will print things out. And then

2
00:18.140 --> 00:20.310
you'll notice a little percent sign here.

3
00:21.440 --> 00:27.680
So remember the echo command and the printf command both print text to the screen, but printf does it slightly

4
00:27.680 --> 00:28.220
differently.

5
00:28.520 --> 00:30.320
It's kind of just good to know that it's out there.

6
00:31.520 --> 00:33.260
So if you go edit the script

7
00:37.670 --> 00:44.360
and at the very end here, put in a '\n' and that basically creates a new line.

8
00:48.320 --> 00:55.160
And you run your script again with './second_script.sh' and there you'll see that percent is gone

9
00:55.160 --> 00:59.610
because if you don't have that new line in there, it won't make it.

10
01:01.790 --> 01:03.480
And I can illustrate that for you.

11
01:08.960 --> 01:14.450
So you could type--let's put it like it was, and then do another printf here.

12
01:19.940 --> 01:25.190
'something else'.  So even though these are on two different lines,

13
01:28.310 --> 01:29.120
if you run it,

14
01:30.430 --> 01:35.980
it's without--if you don't have that '\n' in there, it'll just print it on the same line.

15
01:37.210 --> 01:41.150
So that's why you normally will use the echo command to use your text.

16
01:41.740 --> 01:50.150
The reason you had to do the './' here is because that's saying what directory your script is in.

17
01:51.370 --> 01:55.990
So '.' is another syntax for the current directory.

18
01:56.960 --> 02:03.110
You can see what directory director you're in with this pwd command, print-working-directory.

19
02:04.960 --> 02:05.830
So there I am.

20
02:06.730 --> 02:08.070
So I could actually type this in

21
02:08.080 --> 02:13.480
and then do second_script.sh: same thing.

22
02:13.750 --> 02:17.050
So '.' is just a shortcut for the current directory that you're in.

23
02:18.310 --> 02:24.310
So in the next lecture, you'll ask some debugging options to your script and you'll get some more practice

24
02:24.310 --> 02:29.820
making and writing a script in vim and changing the mode to add execution.
