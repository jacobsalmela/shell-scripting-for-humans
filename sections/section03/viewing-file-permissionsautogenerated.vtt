So this 'ls' command doesn't show you a whole lot, it just shows you the files that are there, but you

1
00:08.930 --> 00:14.210
can actually modify that to show a lot more information if you had this '-l' at the end.

2
00:16.800 --> 00:20.520
And actually, I'm going to make my screen a little bit bigger so that you can see this better.

3
00:21.060 --> 00:24.270
So this shows you some more information about these same files.

4
00:24.270 --> 00:31.070
And just as one one file per line; this probably looks a little bit cryptic, but there's a couple

5
00:31.070 --> 00:32.940
of obvious things we can get out of the way.

6
00:33.210 --> 00:38.340
So there's a timestamp of when that was made--modified, the date,

7
00:39.060 --> 00:41.760
And this is the user and group that owns the file.

8
00:42.870 --> 00:43.910
There's the file name.

9
00:44.430 --> 00:49.920
But what you're really concerned about for running your shell scripts is this line here.

10
00:50.610 --> 00:56.880
And it looks pretty strange if you've never done Linux file permissions before.

11
00:58.080 --> 00:58.980
And that's what these are.

12
00:58.980 --> 01:01.800
These are the file permissions for this particular file.

13
01:02.640 --> 01:08.200
This is also referred to as the mode, which I'll be telling you about very shortly.

14
01:08.250 --> 01:14.070
So for now, just know that "r" is for read.

15
01:15.000 --> 01:16.260
"w" is for write.

16
01:17.220 --> 01:20.640
And then "x", which is usually here, would be for execute.

17
01:22.050 --> 01:25.830
So this file has read, write, read, and read.

18
01:28.700 --> 01:35.540
So you can't actually run your script until you have an "x" in here in this line somewhere to make it

19
01:35.540 --> 01:36.420
executable.

20
01:37.130 --> 01:40.210
I'll show you how to make your script executable in the next section.
