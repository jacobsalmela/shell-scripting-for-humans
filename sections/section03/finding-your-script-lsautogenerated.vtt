00:02.690 --> 00:06.440
So you ran your first script by calling 'bash' and then 'first_script.sh'.

1
00:06.800 --> 00:15.290
So this explicitly uses the bash command to run your script, but since you defined it in your second

2
00:15.290 --> 00:15.680
script.

3
00:16.480 --> 00:22.400
You're already telling it to use bash so you can actually just call the filename itself and your script

4
00:22.400 --> 00:27.970
will run because you predefined that it will use bash here.   But where is your script?

5
00:28.180 --> 00:31.120
You need to use a new command to actually see where your script is.

6
00:31.360 --> 00:32.660
That's called 'ls'.

7
00:34.200 --> 00:36.850
So there you see, we have our first and second ones.

8
00:36.850 --> 00:40.810
And this is basically the same thing as--remember from the earlier lectures;

9
00:40.820 --> 00:44.680
this is the same as doing--opening the Finder window and seeing that.

10
00:48.540 --> 00:50.670
So I'm going to split my screen there so you can see.

11
00:53.390 --> 00:59.270
(to self) desktop..
So there's my first and second script, so there's two important things that you need to learn

12
00:59.300 --> 01:05.120
before you can actually run your script, and it probably seems like there's a lot of you know, you

13
01:05.120 --> 01:07.460
have to keep learning this, to learn this, to do that.

14
01:07.730 --> 01:10.450
And you haven't really actually written a script yet.

15
01:11.180 --> 01:15.320
But these are some foundational things that will make sense,

16
01:15.320 --> 01:19.010
and then they will--you'll be able to do them really fast.

17
01:19.040 --> 01:21.590
So this first first part is going to be really slow,

18
01:21.590 --> 01:27.620
and then once you get some foundational knowledge, then you'll be writing scripts like it's nobody's

19
01:27.620 --> 01:28.220
business.
