So if you're brand new to Linux or shell scripting, you might be wondering why things have such weird

1
00:07.970 --> 00:08.610
names.

2
00:08.630 --> 00:13.720
Well, in the early days of computers, things like memory, disk space and even bandwidth were limited.

3
00:14.360 --> 00:20.600
So having command names that were very short, precise, it was easier for the computer to execute with

4
00:20.600 --> 00:22.370
a limited amount of resources.

5
00:23.390 --> 00:29.700
You'll also find some commands that are named after their creators like this awk command.

6
00:32.000 --> 00:41.600
It was written by A. V. Aho--"a", B. W. Kernighan--"k," and P.J. Weinberger--"w".

7
00:42.410 --> 00:49.640
Other times, the reason they're explained or named weirdly, is because people have sort of a nerdy

8
00:49.640 --> 00:50.470
sense of humor.

9
00:51.320 --> 00:56.990
So there's commands like touch or finger that can produce some interesting commands if the context is

10
00:56.990 --> 00:57.340
right.
