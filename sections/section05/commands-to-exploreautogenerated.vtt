So, you know already that there are some commands in /usr/bin, but there's a couple other places

1
00:12.060 --> 00:17.670
you can look and explore for commands.  There's /usr/sbin, which is like super user commands.

2
00:18.780 --> 00:24.180
so these ones, you might not be able to run if you're just a regular user, but you can at least look

3
00:24.180 --> 00:25.050
and see what's there.

4
00:26.310 --> 00:36.720
There's usually some in /usr/local/sbin--bin--so /usr/sbin and /usr/bin.

5
00:37.590 --> 00:41.880
So try looking through those locations and see if you can use the help flag in any of those other ones.
