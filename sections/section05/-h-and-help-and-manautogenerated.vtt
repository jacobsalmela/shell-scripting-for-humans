00:03.180 --> 00:08.980
So just about every command out there will have like a '-h' flag or '--help' option.

1
00:09.660 --> 00:13.530
So even if you've never used a command before, you can figure out how to use it.

2
00:14.340 --> 00:19.500
So in the last assignment, I had to go explore a bunch of commands that were in this /usr/bin folder.

3
00:20.820 --> 00:24.000
And based on the names, could you guess what any of them would do?

4
00:25.170 --> 00:27.110
This is a good way to start learning what's out there.

5
00:27.960 --> 00:34.410
And since you know now that most commands have a built in help option, you can try running it even

6
00:34.410 --> 00:37.740
if you've never used the command or have no idea what it is.

7
00:38.550 --> 00:40.440
So let's try this out on a few commands.

8
00:40.440 --> 00:43.560
Let's try 'ls

9
00:44.490 --> 00:45.390
--help'.

10
00:46.950 --> 00:50.570
Well there wasn't a help option, actually, for this.

11
00:50.590 --> 00:55.500
See, it said an illegal option?  But it did show you a little usage line for the command.

12
00:56.010 --> 01:02.490
So all these things that are in between the brackets are optional and even the file path is optional

13
01:02.580 --> 01:08.010
because by default it will just list what's in the file or in the folder that you're in.

14
01:08.370 --> 01:09.900
So let's try this on another one.

15
01:10.260 --> 01:12.330
Touch, the touch command.

16
01:12.390 --> 01:13.950
Let's try a '-h' there.

17
01:15.540 --> 01:22.720
So that one it didn't complain that it wasn't a bad option, but it also showed us a little line here.

18
01:23.850 --> 01:30.810
So based on this, you can see that all these things in brackets are optional, but then it needs a

19
01:30.810 --> 01:31.350
file.

20
01:31.620 --> 01:37.110
So how are you supposed to know what all those these different modifiers are or even what the command

21
01:37.110 --> 01:37.620
does?

22
01:38.560 --> 01:41.400
The help the sort of usage line doesn't really tell you that.

23
01:41.430 --> 01:46.110
So if you've never used the touch command before, you need some more--

24
01:46.350 --> 01:48.120
another way to get information on it.

25
01:48.540 --> 01:50.400
So this is where man pages come in.

26
01:50.580 --> 01:53.990
Man here is short for manual--manual page.

27
01:54.810 --> 01:57.630
So if you type 'man touch'.

28
02:00.350 --> 02:03.360
[sensual music] maaaan toooouch

29
02:04.900 --> 02:09.980
This will open up a detailed manual page on how to use it.

30
02:10.330 --> 02:18.040
So here it's telling you what each flag does and, you know, different options you can pass to it.

31
02:20.750 --> 02:22.950
And then these are all--you see

32
02:22.960 --> 02:24.400
it's pretty--pretty detailed.

33
02:25.180 --> 02:27.190
And you can just press "q" here to exit.

34
02:27.430 --> 02:33.130
So knowing all these tricks, you can usually find a command, figure out how to use it, and then implemented

35
02:33.130 --> 02:33.880
in your script.

36
02:34.720 --> 02:38.860
So this is actually a large part of shell scripting is just adding to the knowledge of commands that

37
02:38.860 --> 02:42.340
you know and commands at your disposal and how to use them.
