All right, so for these next few lectures, I'm going to have you install an extra utility that will

1
00:09.370 --> 00:13.690
allow you to install some other third party commands and stuff.

2
00:16.300 --> 00:19.540
So if you go to your browser and go to https://brew.sh.

3
00:22.370 --> 00:28.430
There's this command right here, and look, they're using the command output in a variable, how cool

4
00:28.430 --> 00:28.910
is that?

5
00:29.510 --> 00:31.130
So you can just copy this command.

6
00:33.090 --> 00:34.470
Paste it into your terminal

7
00:37.820 --> 00:40.340
and then just let that run and finish installing.
