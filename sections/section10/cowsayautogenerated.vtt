'brew install cowsay'

1
00:07.730 --> 00:13.460
I actually already have it installed, so it'll do it, yeah, already installed,  'cowsay': it's just

2
00:13.460 --> 00:17.420
a fun way to replace or--your echo command.

3
00:17.420 --> 00:21.760
So I go, 'echo yep, thats a cow all right'

4
00:27.420 --> 00:29.770
Do the same thing, but with 'cowsay'

5
00:32.840 --> 00:34.610
and then just a cow says it.
