So this is the graphical interface or the GUI, graphical user interface.

1
00:10.720 --> 00:17.620
There's windows, buttons, colors, text, all sorts of stuff that makes it really comfortable and

2
00:17.620 --> 00:18.520
easy to use.

3
00:19.750 --> 00:25.420
But when you switch to doing shell scripts, you're going to use what's called a command line interface.

4
00:26.260 --> 00:28.000
So you actually have one built into your Mac.

5
00:28.000 --> 00:28.930
It's called Terminal.

6
00:29.170 --> 00:33.390
If you press command and space, you'll open this little searchlight window.

7
00:34.510 --> 00:39.370
If you don't have that, you can click this little magnifying glass and just type in 'terminal'.

8
00:40.300 --> 00:43.150
And it's usually the first response and just press enter.

9
00:44.270 --> 00:52.670
And that will open it up.  So I'm going to put these windows side by side so you can kind of see how

10
00:52.670 --> 00:53.710
things compare here.

11
00:55.040 --> 00:59.060
So in the GUI, you can click around and move.

12
00:59.870 --> 01:02.840
So and then it shows you your files right away.

13
01:03.740 --> 01:08.330
When you go to the command line interface, you have to actually, those are individual commands.

14
01:09.030 --> 01:11.870
So there's a command called cd, for <i>change directory</i>.

15
01:13.280 --> 01:15.740
So if I want to go to my Desktop, I can do that.

16
01:18.190 --> 01:20.320
So you see, it didn't list the file immediately.

17
01:21.410 --> 01:28.120
There's actually a separate command for that, which is ls, for list.

18
01:28.720 --> 01:30.040
There, you'll see the same file there.

19
01:31.030 --> 01:31.840

01:31.840 --> 01:32.530

21
01:34.550 --> 01:41.570
Now, you can also go in there in the GUI, and you know, right click Move to Trash.

22
01:43.850 --> 01:48.200
I'm just going to undo that so you can see this will disappear in the command line as well.

23
01:49.550 --> 01:55.040
You can type rm, for remove, and the file name and there it goes.

24
01:58.000 --> 02:07.450
You can also view files--like the actual content of them--you know, in the menu over here.

25
02:09.520 --> 02:13.620
And there's a equivalent command called cat.

26
02:15.300 --> 02:19.040
And this is actually in the Documents folder.

27
02:21.760 --> 02:24.400
So there you'll see it's the same same file.

28
02:27.160 --> 02:30.310
And then here's another similarity.

29
02:30.370 --> 02:33.450
You can-- there's metadata about this file.

30
02:33.490 --> 02:36.720
It recognizes that it's a Python source file.

31
02:38.230 --> 02:42.520
There's a just a file command which gives you some information on what type of file it is.

32
02:46.270 --> 02:48.340
So there you can see it's a Python script.

33
02:50.180 --> 02:54.470
And there a Python source, so the words are a little different, but it's essentially the same thing.

34
02:56.180 --> 03:02.270
So hopefully this summarizes for you that what you can do in the GUI, the graphical interface, you

35
03:02.270 --> 03:05.570
can also do in the command line, CLI.
