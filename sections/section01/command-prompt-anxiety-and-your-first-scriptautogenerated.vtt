All right, so there can be a lot of anxiety sometimes switching from this nice, pretty interface over

1
00:10.520 --> 00:16.070
to this black and white screen with just text, you know, it's really cryptic.

2
00:16.080 --> 00:21.820
Maybe it's kind of archaic, but you can actually do all the same things as I showed in the last lecture.

3
00:22.910 --> 00:27.160
So I'm going to show you something else to kind of help maybe alleviate some of that anxiety.

4
00:28.550 --> 00:32.150
So I'm just going to reset my screen here so this works properly.

5
00:33.620 --> 00:38.270
So if you're on a Mac, just try this: type, 'say', space,

6
00:38.270 --> 00:38.750
'hello.'

7
00:39.230 --> 00:39.910
"Hello."

8
00:40.820 --> 00:42.650
And there your computer talks to you.

9
00:42.740 --> 00:43.730
How cool is that?

10
00:44.930 --> 00:48.620
If you happen to be on Linux, you can try this one: 
[typing 'curl http:/wttr.in']

11
00:55.160 --> 01:02.180
And there you get the nice little weather, nice, pretty graphics, so even though the command line

12
01:02.180 --> 01:09.770
might seem like it's, you know, kind of a step backwards, there's still some familiar pieces to it.

13
01:11.390 --> 01:11.810
All right.

14
01:13.010 --> 01:19.400
So I'm going to clear my screen here and then you're going to start writing your first script.

15
01:21.050 --> 01:22.340
So type this: 'echo'

16
01:23.780 --> 01:25.310
'this is my first script'

17
01:27.830 --> 01:30.650
And then this little greater than sign.

18
01:33.300 --> 01:40.860
And name it first_script.sh.  And now that was your first script, it's just a simple one line

19
01:40.860 --> 01:49.880
script, but you can run it now by typing 'bash', which is the command that you want to run it with.

20
01:51.360 --> 01:56.550
And then 'first_script.sh', and there it prints out your text.

21
01:57.600 --> 02:03.750
And that's because you wrote this command here, echo, which is the command, and then whatever text

22
02:03.750 --> 02:04.320
follows it.
