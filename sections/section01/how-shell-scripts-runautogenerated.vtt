So how do your Shell scripts actually run?

1
00:07.330 --> 00:16.300
Well, when you typed in, 'say', and then 'whatever-text-you-wanted', this say command; you were telling the computer

2
00:16.300 --> 00:21.470
to use that say command and then passing it whatever information you wanted.

3
00:22.600 --> 00:30.820
So your your little command line prompt here is interpreting what command you want to run and with what

4
00:30.820 --> 00:31.390
arguments.

5
00:32.980 --> 00:36.880
So that's why you call the shell a command line interpreter.

6
00:38.410 --> 00:40.870
So basically that's all what shell scripting is.

7
00:42.010 --> 00:44.590
So you can type in as many commands as you want.

8
00:45.520 --> 00:46.330
echo this.

9
00:46.330 --> 00:48.490
echo that.

10
00:49.750 --> 00:55.630
So if you copied and pasted these two lines right into a file and ran it with Bash, it would print

11
00:55.630 --> 00:56.410
this and that.

12
00:57.910 --> 01:03.010
So that's kind of the nice thing about shell scripting versus other programming languages--

13
01:03.940 --> 01:11.770
--and shell code really isn't a programming language per-say, but it's really nice because you can just

14
01:11.770 --> 01:17.900
type out the commands and try them out yourself first and then paste them into a file and they'll run

15
01:17.920 --> 01:18.970
exactly the same way.
