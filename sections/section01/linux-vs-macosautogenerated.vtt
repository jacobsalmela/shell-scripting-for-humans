00:03.020 --> 00:09.410
So I put as having a Mac as a requirement for this course, because it works really well for learning

1
00:09.410 --> 00:11.720
shell scripting, because it has everything you need on it.

2
00:12.560 --> 00:16.940
You have your graphical interface, which you're probably already used to, and then you can just open

3
00:16.940 --> 00:18.680
up Terminal and start typing right away.

4
00:19.010 --> 00:22.100
And there's even a built in text editor to help you write your scripts.

5
00:22.640 --> 00:24.050
But I'm just going to show you something here.

6
00:26.420 --> 00:28.130
You don't have to worry about what I'm doing right now.

7
00:28.130 --> 00:31.880
I'm just setting up a little Linux machine that I can show you some differences.

8
00:33.380 --> 00:37.610
So basically, what's the difference between macOS and Linux?

9
00:38.630 --> 00:40.450
The good news is for you, not very much.

10
00:41.810 --> 00:45.230
So that's what the shell--that's why shells were developed.

11
00:45.530 --> 00:52.190
So basically your shell could stay mostly the same, you know, commands could be the same.

12
00:53.180 --> 00:59.750
And then you can put that shell on a different operating system and it would run just the same.

13
01:01.600 --> 01:06.850
I'm just logging into my Linux machine over here now so I can show you some differences.

14
01:08.190 --> 01:16.890
So I echo what shell I'm, in, so you'll notice that we used bash, but this one is another show called

15
01:16.890 --> 01:20.190
zsh, which is basically compatible with bash.

16
01:22.300 --> 01:29.700
If I take the same thing over here, there's the bash that we used before and, you'll notice I

17
01:29.700 --> 01:31.630
was able to use the echo command on both.

18
01:32.130 --> 01:40.100
So this is Linux and this is macOS, which is also goes by the name Darwin.

19
01:40.650 --> 01:46.200
But I mean, even see here, since these are totally different systems, I was able to run the same

20
01:46.200 --> 01:48.330
command and get different output.

21
01:49.950 --> 01:55.950
So that's why shell scripting is kind of appealing because, you know, I can develop my shell script

22
01:55.950 --> 02:00.360
on the Mac and then if I want it to run Linux, I can have it do that.

23
02:02.040 --> 02:06.570
That's easier said than done, of course, but by the end of the course, you'll have some skills to

24
02:06.570 --> 02:07.860
know how to do just that.
