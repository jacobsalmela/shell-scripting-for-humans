All right, so what is a function?  A function is just a piece of reusable code.

1
00:07.670 --> 00:12.020
So right now, your script--none of the scripts you've written so far have any functions;

2
00:12.800 --> 00:14.780
it's basically just a whole bunch of commands.

3
00:15.950 --> 00:18.530
So let's look at your 'cd' script:

4
00:21.330 --> 00:27.630
So this is just one line and this would actually make a really nice function because it's just doing

5
00:27.630 --> 00:28.670
two simple things.

6
00:28.680 --> 00:36.570
It's going to 'cd' to a directory and then list what's in it. So you can actually do some cool here.

7
00:37.240 --> 00:40.620
So if you do, 'vim .bash_profile'

8
00:44.280 --> 00:52.570
So this command--or this file might not exist yet, and that's OK.

9
00:54.390 --> 00:56.070
So we're going to paste this in...

10
00:59.700 --> 01:05.490
and then to make a function, you give it a name and then two parentheses.

11
01:12.590 --> 01:14.540
and then a bracket,

12
01:17.180 --> 01:18.380
and the closing bracket.

13
01:21.860 --> 01:24.980
After you type this command: 'source' that file

14
01:26.180 --> 01:27.800
Now, you can just type 'cd'

15
01:30.520 --> 01:39.550
You see?  So you're you basically overrode the the existing 'cd' command and made it your own with that.

16
01:40.330 --> 01:51.310
If you're on Linux, um, you can--you might be able to add it to this command (file), '.bashrc'.  [To self] That doesn't exist either.

17
01:52.600 --> 01:57.490
But this .bash_profile, you can basically put whatever functions you want in there.

18
01:58.270 --> 02:03.640
And then when you log in--this is essentially the same thing as logging in.

19
02:04.060 --> 02:05.620
It just reads this file.

20
02:06.810 --> 02:13.290
So now, any time you use the 'cd' command, it'll list what's in there for you.

21
02:15.060 --> 02:17.070
So now you don't even really need that script:

22
02:17.100 --> 02:19.800
you don't have to go './cd /tmp'

23
02:26.290 --> 02:28.160
So let's look at that.

24
02:32.030 --> 02:32.310
There.

25
02:32.330 --> 02:39.290
So this is just how you define a function: you have--you give it a name, the parentheses, and then

26
02:39.290 --> 02:42.360
whatever code you want to run inside these brackets here.

27
02:42.860 --> 02:45.260
So this could be, you know, just these two commands.

28
02:45.260 --> 02:46.850
It could be a hundred commands.

29
02:47.720 --> 02:51.680
It's usually better just to keep them keep functions relatively short and

30
02:53.730 --> 02:56.520
simple so you can follow them.  But,

31
02:57.440 --> 02:58.460
that works just the same.
