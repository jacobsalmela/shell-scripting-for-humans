So let's look at our script here...so the cleanup function,

1
00:12.990 --> 00:21.690
maybe this cleanup function is only going to run if your script runs into some sort of error so you

2
00:21.690 --> 00:24.030
can actually use return codes here, too.

3
00:25.440 --> 00:25.740
Yeah,

4
00:25.740 --> 00:32.760
so let's just give it a random return code of a non-zero number and then just pretend that

5
00:37.930 --> 00:39.420
'this only runs when theres a problem'

6
00:48.950 --> 00:55.720
So if you look at that return code, 55, because there was that cleanup function that ran last.

7
00:56.950 --> 01:03.010
So that's another way you can kind of you can use your return codes with inside your functions as well

8
01:03.010 --> 01:04.530
as your script itself.
