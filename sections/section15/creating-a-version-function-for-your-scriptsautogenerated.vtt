All right, so now that you know about functions, we can start getting into some more cool, complex stuff.

1
00:09.260 --> 00:17.390
So let's make a script called 'version.sh'.  
With the ol' shebang. 
[Musical signing] She-bang!

2
00:26.020 --> 00:36.590
So let's just make a variable here called--this will just be an arbitrary version and then make a function

3
00:37.040 --> 00:37.940
called version.

4
00:39.420 --> 00:53.400
So I put the variable name in caps here--so version, parentheses, bracket, and then we want to

5
00:53.730 --> 00:54.000
'echo $VERSION'

6
00:56.820 --> 01:00.930
'exit 0' and then close it out.

7
01:01.500 --> 01:05.100
So we want to exit 0 because all we're doing is printing a version;

8
01:05.130 --> 01:07.830
there's nothing really bad going to happen there.

9
01:09.390 --> 01:10.740
So quit that. 
[Typing]

10
01:20.520 --> 01:23.970
But that didn't actually do anything, and that's I expected that. (did I?)

11
01:26.490 --> 01:33.900
So if you go when you define the function like you did here, you're not actually calling it, you're

12
01:33.900 --> 01:40.650
just calling it that--that you want to have that code there to be able to use, but then you actually have

13
01:40.650 --> 01:41.430
go and call it.

14
01:43.290 --> 01:46.650
So here you just type the name of your function and it will run.

15
01:50.240 --> 01:59.000
'1.0'.  So the cool thing is you can reuse your function: type it again.

16
02:02.720 --> 02:03.130
So.

17
02:08.260 --> 02:13.660
Yeah, so the code exited there, but if you remove that...

18
02:16.610 --> 02:19.820
you can use so you can reuse the code as much as you'd like.

19
02:25.040 --> 02:29.340
So for now, we'll just leave it like that.

20
02:29.510 --> 02:32.630
So that will be your version script using a function.
