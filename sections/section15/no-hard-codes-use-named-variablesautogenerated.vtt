Right, so let's add another function to your script here.

1
00:09.190 --> 00:11.270
Let's get rid of some of this stuff because...

2
00:13.970 --> 00:15.980
...we don't need it.

3
00:20.850 --> 00:21.140
There.

4
00:22.290 --> 00:24.030
So now it's only going to print the version.

5
00:26.530 --> 00:27.720
Let's make another function.

6
00:30.900 --> 00:37.490
'cleanup', so it's--in a lot of your scripts, it's nice to have a little clean up function in case you're

7
00:38.240 --> 00:43.400
using a bunch of temporary files or whatever.  So let's  just say...

8
00:46.170 --> 00:53.540
'running clean up...', and then you might want to use-- like clean up what's in the folder.

9
01:00.170 --> 01:05.880
So this would forcefully remove anything in whatever folder you pass to this function.

10
01:06.860 --> 01:15.200
So just like you can use these dollar sign number variables in your script, you can use them inside

11
01:15.200 --> 01:16.230
of a function as well.

12
01:24.180 --> 01:26.910
So here, this will be a good example:

13
01:32.290 --> 01:35.890
'removing files from' there. So we're not actually going to do that.

14
01:38.660 --> 01:42.060
But I want to show you that these two are different as well.

15
01:44.060 --> 01:46.680
So this is also--kind of relates to the variable scope.

16
01:47.600 --> 01:50.990
So you say 'you passed

17
01:54.360 --> 01:54.840
$1

18
02:00.950 --> 02:01.660
to the script'

19
02:03.660 --> 02:05.730
You're going to see that these two are going to be different.

20
02:08.330 --> 02:11.420
We'll say 'cleanup /tmp'

21
02:17.080 --> 02:17.600
Now if we run out script...

22
02:19.200 --> 02:25.140
So you passed to the script, nothing... [typing] '/home'

23
02:30.100 --> 02:35.320
So you passed /home to the script, but then it's going to be removing files from /tmp

24
02:41.860 --> 02:43.000
so this

25
02:43.000 --> 02:43.690
$1 here

26
02:46.520 --> 02:56.270
is the argument you passed to the script itself, but this $1 here is what you passed down here

27
02:56.270 --> 02:57.020
to the function.

28
02:59.420 --> 03:03.250
So this is another good reason why you want to use named the variables.

29
03:04.760 --> 03:05.870
So if you just do

30
03:09.370 --> 03:11.690
first_arg and at least give it a name of something,

31
03:15.110 --> 03:27.140
change that.  And even here this can be a local variable--so you can name it 'local dir_to_clean

32
03:31.810 --> 03:32.070
=$1'

33
03:39.710 --> 03:42.020
So if you run that again...

34
03:43.450 --> 03:49.810
You still passed /home to the script and then your /tmp  there, but then if you look at your code,

35
03:52.110 --> 03:53.440
it's a lot easier to read.

36
03:53.940 --> 03:59.880
So you know that this first arg is the one that was passed on your script and this one is the one passed

37
03:59.880 --> 04:01.590
to the function, right there.
