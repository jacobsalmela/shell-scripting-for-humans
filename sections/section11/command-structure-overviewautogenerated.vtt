00:02.470 --> 00:07.630
So when you're using a command and trying to learn how to use it, you first want to check what arguments

1
00:07.630 --> 00:08.150
are needed.

2
00:12.560 --> 00:20.610
And you can see the requirements are usually arguments, the required fields, and then those are all

3
00:20.630 --> 00:21.730
the options.

4
00:21.860 --> 00:26.600
So you use the arguments to see what's required for the program to function properly.

5
00:27.440 --> 00:35.270
And then the options and the flags are what you use to modify the behavior to do it something slightly

6
00:35.270 --> 00:35.810
differently.

7
00:37.580 --> 00:43.400
And you can find all this stuff in with the--the help flags or in the man pages.

8
00:44.240 --> 00:50.120
And sometimes if a command doesn't have any documentation, then you just have to go to the old Internet

9
00:50.120 --> 00:51.190
and search for it.
