All right, so part of what I wanted you to see in that last section was some of the nerdy fun stuff,

1
00:07.010 --> 00:12.590
but I also wanted you to use some of your own critical thinking skills to see if you could figure out

2
00:12.590 --> 00:17.810
how to do something without really knowing much about the commands themselves based on what you already

3
00:17.810 --> 00:18.110
know.

4
00:18.980 --> 00:25.160
So this is actually what scripting often is or programming and even using Linux is all about.

5
00:26.330 --> 00:29.740
You might know that there is something out there that might do what you want.

6
00:29.760 --> 00:32.850
So doing a little exploring on your own will go a long way.

7
00:33.560 --> 00:39.470
So it's a good idea to see how commands are structured so you can figure them out even if you've never

8
00:39.470 --> 00:40.370
used them before.

9
00:41.300 --> 00:43.070
And that's what we'll be talking about next.
