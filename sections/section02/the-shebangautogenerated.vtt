So that first line of text that you just wrote is called The Shebang
[inspiring music and signing] sha-a-a-a-bang!

1
00:13.030 --> 00:19.350
basically when you run your script before we were calling it, you know, we've said 'bash first_script.sh',

2
00:19.490 --> 00:25.840
So when you typed this line, it tells you that you don't have to type that bash command anymore

3
00:25.840 --> 00:27.440
because you're defining it right here.

4
00:27.470 --> 00:33.700
You want to say--you're saying, I want to use this program /bin/bash, to run this script.

5
00:34.450 --> 00:37.120
So that's why you should always have this as your very first line.

6
00:39.160 --> 00:50.380
And the Shebang is kind of a weird name, but it comes from this hash sign, ha-SH, and then the

7
00:50.380 --> 00:53.770
exclamation point is called a bang in the Linux world.

8
00:54.460 --> 01:07.040
So "SH-bang", and then "bin-bash".  It might also come from the default shell, but before bash was just sh.

9
01:08.320 --> 01:09.430
So shebang.

10
01:11.650 --> 01:17.380
So it's just kind of a fun thing to learn about, but you can put other stuff in here.

11
01:17.380 --> 01:24.790
So if we wanted to run our write our scripts in sh., we could, but we'll be writing all of ours

12
01:24.790 --> 01:31.780
in bash since bash is used all over the place in Linux and everywhere else.  The only thing you need

13
01:31.780 --> 01:38.440
to remember from this lecture is that this is called the Shebang and it should be the first line in

14
01:38.440 --> 01:42.520
your--any script that you write.
