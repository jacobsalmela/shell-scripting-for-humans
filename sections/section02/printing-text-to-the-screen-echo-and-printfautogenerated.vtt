All right, so you wrote your shebang, you wrote your first comment, and now you're going to write

1
00:11.750 --> 00:17.210
two lines of code that will print text to the screen in a different way.

2
00:18.740 --> 00:21.000
So the first one you've already done on the command line.

3
00:22.760 --> 00:24.440
So just do 'echo text

4
00:26.320 --> 00:31.270
'text from an echo command', and then there's another one you can use, printf.

5
00:33.710 --> 00:40.730
I'm just going to put this in quotes so I can show you something.  'text from a printf command'

6
00:42.790 --> 00:49.270
Both of these commands can be used to print text to the screen, but this one works a little bit

7
00:49.270 --> 00:49.780
differently.

8
00:50.020 --> 00:55.720
So most of the time you're going to use echo, but I'm just showing you to so you can have them in your

9
00:55.780 --> 00:56.560
repertoire.

10
00:56.920 --> 01:02.260
So in the next lecture, you're going to save your file because as you notice, there's no file menu

11
01:02.260 --> 01:04.480
to do File > Save as...

12
01:05.770 --> 01:07.750
So I'll show you how to do that in the next lecture.
