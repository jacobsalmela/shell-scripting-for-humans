00:02.950 --> 00:09.370
So you already wrote a shell script and ran it, but the method by which you did that was not really

1
00:09.370 --> 00:10.330
going to scale that well.

2
00:10.330 --> 00:15.700
You could basically write one line at a time and just have a one line script.

3
00:15.710 --> 00:19.300
But most likely your scripts will want to be a lot longer.

4
00:20.650 --> 00:24.040
So there's actually a built in text editor that can help you do that.

5
00:24.240 --> 00:26.020
It's called...Vim.

6
00:27.820 --> 00:31.870
Might be thinking maybe you could just write your scripts in like Microsoft Word or something.

7
00:32.080 --> 00:36.970
But if you do that, there's just--those programs are word processors.

8
00:36.970 --> 00:42.490
so they have a bunch of formatting and, you know, hyperlinks and all sorts of other stuff that your

9
00:42.490 --> 00:48.190
shell is not going to understand you when you're running shell scripts, you just want just text and

10
00:48.190 --> 00:48.610
that's it.

11
00:50.080 --> 00:51.370
So vim is really good at that.

12
00:51.370 --> 00:55.540
It's just text and editing.

13
00:55.690 --> 01:00.220
Editing these scripts on the command line is very fast and efficient.

14
01:00.220 --> 01:03.820
You can basically write a line of code, close the editor and test your change.

15
01:04.360 --> 01:10.960
If you're still not convinced, you'll find some cool features that are missing from Microsoft Word.

16
01:11.920 --> 01:14.050
You know, you can select multiple lines.

17
01:14.050 --> 01:17.800
You can do a search and replace with a few keystrokes.

18
01:17.830 --> 01:20.170
You can get syntax highlighting.

19
01:20.860 --> 01:23.460
There's custom themes, all sorts of stuff.

20
01:24.580 --> 01:27.040
So let's see how to use it.

21
01:29.590 --> 01:40.780
So just type 'vim' and then 'second_script.sh' since we already made one, so this will be your second one.

22
01:41.030 --> 01:48.140
So all I want you to do for this, this lecture is just type 'vim second_script.sh' and then hit enter and

23
01:48.160 --> 01:49.470
don't press anything else yet.

24
01:50.260 --> 01:54.550
So this is what it's going to look like when you open your file for editing.

25
01:56.440 --> 01:59.410
And then in the next lecture, I'm going to show you how to actually write something.
