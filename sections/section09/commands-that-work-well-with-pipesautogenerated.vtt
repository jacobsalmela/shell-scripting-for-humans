So some commands work better with pipes than others.

1
00:06.290 --> 00:09.680
There's lots of them that deal with text or files that work really good.

2
00:10.550 --> 00:23.690
There's a command called 'tr'.  One called 'sed', 'awk', 'cut', 'grep', 'diff' and 'sort'.

3
00:24.050 --> 00:25.520
You don't have to remember all those right now.

4
00:25.520 --> 00:27.080
I'm just showing you a few examples.

5
00:27.540 --> 00:34.340
So usually there's some interactive programs like where the program will and ask a question and you

6
00:34.340 --> 00:35.490
have to type in an answer.

7
00:36.170 --> 00:42.140
Programs like that don't usually work that well with pipes because they're expecting different kind

8
00:42.140 --> 00:43.340
of input from the user

9
00:43.640 --> 00:45.680
that's more procedural.

10
00:47.410 --> 00:53.050
Some of those other programs I listed will work a lot better for pipes, but I think we're going to

11
00:53.050 --> 00:56.230
use a pipe in your script now and we'll see what you can do.
