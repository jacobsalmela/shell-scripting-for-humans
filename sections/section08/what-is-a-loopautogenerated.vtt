What is a loop?  A loop lets you run the same code over and over and you can do some cool stuff with

1
00:12.000 --> 00:12.240
it.

2
00:13.140 --> 00:15.480
So right now your script is broken.

3
00:15.870 --> 00:25.350
It doesn't work at all because the '$files' variable has all these file names in it and you can't actually

4
00:25.590 --> 00:28.710
rename all the files to just a single word.

5
00:29.460 --> 00:35.100
If you want to do a task like this, it's actually easier to just use a little loop that will go through

6
00:35.250 --> 00:39.150
every single file and then do something to each one.

7
00:40.680 --> 00:46.440
Loops are actually good because it can make your code reusable because you don't want to write out a

8
00:46.440 --> 00:51.510
mv--mv statement--rename each of these individual files each time.

9
00:51.780 --> 00:57.750
Because what if you get an IMG9915? Then you have to go in and modify your script

10
00:57.750 --> 00:58.980
to rename that.

11
01:00.090 --> 01:01.770
That's not tedious.

12
01:01.890 --> 01:10.800
So you want to make a generic loop that can match any of these image files because they are probably

13
01:10.800 --> 01:12.470
most likely start with IMG;

14
01:12.750 --> 01:15.330
they'll just have a number at the end.  And then,

15
01:16.870 --> 01:21.300
you want to be able to reuse your script any time you get some new pictures like these.

16
01:23.050 --> 01:26.320
So the loop that we're going to make will do just that.
