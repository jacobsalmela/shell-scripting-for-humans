So checking if something is true in your script is pretty useful, but in order for it to be a little

1
00:08.820 --> 00:12.300
more versatile, it should know what to do if something is not true.

2
00:13.260 --> 00:15.810
So that's where, if/else statements come in.

3
00:16.650 --> 00:20.970
So this just kind of expands upon your if statement.

4
00:24.260 --> 00:33.350
So once--here, instead of just ending it with 'fi', you'll have another line that says 'else' and then you put two

5
00:33.350 --> 00:44.510
spaces in there and say so if the variable name is not a file, the else condition will say it's not

6
00:44.510 --> 00:44.990
a file.

7
00:46.760 --> 00:50.960
So that's really all there is to adding some extra logic to your thing.

8
00:52.340 --> 00:59.030
So right now, this is--this else statement will never get reached because we already know that this is a

9
00:59.030 --> 01:03.310
file, but let's run it anyway and see what happens.

10
01:05.830 --> 01:14.890
Yep, so you can actually do a 'bash -x' to get some output and see that it does test for it still.

11
01:19.130 --> 01:28.820
So it's checking--so that's checking--the file names match,  That checks if it's a file and then it just

12
01:28.820 --> 01:32.120
is done because that else statement doesn't get checked.
