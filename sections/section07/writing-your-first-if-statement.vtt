I'm going to show you how to write an if statement.

1
00:04.040 --> 00:09.830
It's basically a simple way to check if a certain condition exists in your code and then do something

2
00:09.830 --> 00:11.000
based on that result.

3
00:12.430 --> 00:15.110
Copy your cmd_ouput_vars.sh

4
00:16.830 --> 00:27.220
And just make a 'if.sh' script and then go in and edit that, if.sh file. So that saved

5
00:27.220 --> 00:34.760
you some typing there and the if statement looks like this: you do 'if

6
00:37.640 --> 00:39.440
"Something equals true"

7
00:42.230 --> 00:44.330
Col--semicolon,
'then'

8
00:48.410 --> 00:59.480
"do something"
"do stuff here" and then you close the if statement with the 'fi' word--just if backwards.

9
01:01.580 --> 01:08.480
Maybe we want to match if our file name is equal to something then we can do something based on that.

10
01:11.020 --> 01:25.570
So let's go up and edit this, let's say "if our filename is equal to--and I'll put 'vars.sh', then we want

11
01:25.570 --> 01:28.180
to just say...

12
01:31.400 --> 01:33.260
'filename matches!'

13
01:37.310 --> 01:46.910
escape and ":wq!"--the bang sign there, was just out of habit for me, it overrides basically force

14
01:46.910 --> 01:53.060
overrides the saving of the file and we don't need to do the 'chmod' because we actually copied the

15
01:53.060 --> 01:53.510
file.

16
01:54.050 --> 01:58.850
So it has the execute permissions on there already.

17
02:02.330 --> 02:02.820
There we go.

18
02:03.350 --> 02:09.080
So filename is cmd_output_vars.sh, and then our 'if' statement worked.

19
02:12.470 --> 02:14.870
So we said "if the file name,

20
02:16.510 --> 02:24.980
which is cmd_output_vars.sh, is equal to cmd_output_vars.sh, then each then print this message"

21
02:25.780 --> 02:28.120
So that was just our little if conditional check.

22
02:29.650 --> 02:31.720
So now you know how to write an if statement.

23
02:32.860 --> 02:42.130
You do 'if [[ your condition ]]; then echo stuff; fi'
