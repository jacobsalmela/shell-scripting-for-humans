All right, well, so far in this course, you've made scripts that are very short and don't really

1
00:06.300 --> 00:07.260
do a whole lot.

2
00:07.620 --> 00:09.470
So that's going to start to change now.

3
00:10.410 --> 00:12.090
We've already learned quite a few commands.

4
00:12.090 --> 00:13.980
You can navigate the file system.

5
00:14.580 --> 00:17.520
You can create scripts and modify the permissions.

6
00:17.520 --> 00:20.040
You also know how to create and expand variables.

7
00:21.270 --> 00:23.940
And soon you'll start making a script that will do something useful.

8
00:24.930 --> 00:28.440
So let me show you how to use some if statements in the next lecture.
