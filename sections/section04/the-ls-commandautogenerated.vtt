So you've already seen this ls command quite a bit, can do plus, 'ls -l' to see more files, you know,

1
00:09.120 --> 00:10.060
on a single line.

2
00:11.050 --> 00:12.540
But here's something new you can do with it.

3
00:12.550 --> 00:18.340
You can actually give it a file path and list what's in there, even though that's not the folder that

4
00:18.340 --> 00:18.770
you're in.

5
00:19.360 --> 00:23.610
So we're in Desktop/ right now, but I listed the /Users folder.

6
00:24.220 --> 00:27.730
So this helps you look around at files that maybe you're not actually in.

7
00:29.500 --> 00:31.120
You can try the same thing on Linux.

8
00:31.120 --> 00:37.090
You can give it 'ls -l /home' because there's no /Users on Linux.

9
00:39.040 --> 00:45.040
And when you had to do that dot slash syntax, that was actually giving it a full path.

10
00:46.810 --> 00:53.590
So you did second script--dot slash, second script, so that dot was a shortcut.  So you could do

11
00:53.590 --> 00:58.210
'ls ..' and that would do the one directory above you.

12
00:59.230 --> 01:02.610
So that's basically in my home folder there.

13
01:03.010 --> 01:08.160
And if I do /Users/goku there's the same thing.

14
01:08.680 --> 01:10.720
So sometimes there's some shortcuts you can use.

15
01:10.990 --> 01:12.600
Just something good to know.
