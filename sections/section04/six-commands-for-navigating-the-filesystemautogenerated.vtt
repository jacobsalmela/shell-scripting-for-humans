So you're going to write a simple file browser script, that's the goal for this section, and I'm going

1
00:10.460 --> 00:14.790
to teach you about some commands that are available to use to do that.

2
00:16.010 --> 00:21.500
So, again, the Linux like philosophy is basically to write really small programs that do one thing

3
00:21.680 --> 00:22.370
really well.

4
00:23.180 --> 00:25.460
So there's six commands that will do just that.

5
00:26.840 --> 00:37.250
There's the ls command to list files, cd command to change directories, move command to move files

6
00:37.250 --> 00:48.350
and also rename them, the rm command to delete folders and files, copy command to copy files and folders,

7
00:48.410 --> 00:51.520
and then cat to concatenate files, and view files.

8
00:52.040 --> 00:54.950
So let's cover each of those a little bit more in depth.
