So you've done a bit of work already inside the shell, inside of a shell script, and directly on the

1
00:08.060 --> 00:13.340
command line, so it's kind of helpful to think about shell scripts as a place to compile a bunch of

2
00:13.340 --> 00:15.620
commands that you already know.

3
00:15.990 --> 00:21.680
At the end of this section, you're going to read a simple shell script that will emulate part of a file

4
00:21.680 --> 00:23.630
exploring app such as the Finder here.

5
00:24.430 --> 00:29.030
So there's all sorts of commands that can come preinstalled and are available to you already.

6
00:29.300 --> 00:35.870
And you can also add some more by installing some other third party software, third party commands.

7
00:36.080 --> 00:41.570
But basically you're just going to be exploring the command line and doing some experimentation directly

8
00:41.570 --> 00:49.040
on the command line so you can convert that into a shell script to save yourself some time, which is

9
00:49.040 --> 00:51.710
also a common motivation for writing shell scripts.

10
00:53.090 --> 00:57.500
So if you figure out how to do something on the command line, you can basically copy and paste those

11
00:57.500 --> 01:02.660
commands right into your shell script and in its simplest state, that works.

12
01:03.950 --> 01:08.720
So there's going to be times that you'll need to learn extra things like if statements or loops or conditional

13
01:08.720 --> 01:12.020
checks, but you'll be learning about those in the later lesson.

14
01:13.700 --> 01:18.980
And then the commands you're about to learn are often the first thing many Linux 101 courses

15
01:18.980 --> 01:19.640
will teach you.

16
01:20.660 --> 01:26.630
But since you're learning shell scripting and Linux, there's a specific reason I left these out of

17
01:26.630 --> 01:29.150
the curriculum until now, which you'll see.

18
01:30.290 --> 01:34.790
And as you're progressing through the section and learning new commands, try to think about how they

19
01:34.790 --> 01:39.350
could be used inside of a shell script that would act as a file browser.
