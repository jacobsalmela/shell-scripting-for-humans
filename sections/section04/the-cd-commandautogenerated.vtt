So the cd command lets you move to different directories and I showed you how you could do 'ls ..'

1
00:08.610 --> 00:14.560
to list the directory above you, you can also do that same thing with cd.

2
00:15.430 --> 00:17.060
So now I'm in my home folder.

3
00:19.900 --> 00:27.100
There's those same files can also use cd to jump to any directory on the system if you know the path

4
00:27.100 --> 00:27.500
to it.

5
00:28.660 --> 00:29.170
So.

6
00:30.940 --> 00:36.220
Most machines will have this /tmp folder, you can just jump right to it, even though it's not anywhere

7
00:36.430 --> 00:40.090
near where you are--you can do the same thing on Linux.

8
00:41.440 --> 00:44.920
And then if you do 'ls' here, there's just a bunch of temp files

9
00:49.420 --> 00:55.750
and then one other cool trick you can do a cd is you can do a 'cd -' and then I'll take you back to

10
00:55.750 --> 00:57.700
the directory that you were last in.
