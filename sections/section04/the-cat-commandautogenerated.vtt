So now you know how to basically manipulate files, you can move and copy them around, but it's nice

1
00:07.210 --> 00:08.980
to be able to see what's inside them, too.

2
00:09.160 --> 00:11.690
So that's where the cat command comes in useful.

3
00:11.920 --> 00:18.310
So this command is actually kind of interesting because it's one of the most misused commands in all

4
00:18.310 --> 00:18.970
of Linux.

5
00:19.630 --> 00:24.010
And some hardcore Linux users will shame you if you use it the wrong way.

6
00:24.010 --> 00:27.790
But in real life, this is what you'll be doing all the time.

7
00:28.720 --> 00:32.110
So you can just write 'cat my_moved_file'.

8
00:36.300 --> 00:42.630
So there's something in that file, but cat is actually short for concatenate.  You can use this command

9
00:42.630 --> 00:44.250
on your two files at once.

10
00:45.960 --> 00:49.280
my_moved_file and my_copied_file.

11
00:50.780 --> 00:58.190
So this they both had the same thing in their the word "something", so but you can pass as many files

12
00:58.190 --> 00:59.190
as you want to here.

13
01:00.710 --> 01:07.370
You could pass all the files in in the Desktop.

14
01:08.510 --> 01:10.520
So you do 'Desktop/*'.

15
01:13.310 --> 01:18.140
There's just all all of your scripts that you have written, all just in one big line.

16
01:19.010 --> 01:24.560
So there's not always a lot of purpose to concatenate a whole bunch of files, but it can be useful

17
01:24.560 --> 01:31.430
at times, but it's perfectly fine to just use cat get one file and look at it.
