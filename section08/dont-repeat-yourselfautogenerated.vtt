So I already told you it's helpful to, like, reuse your code within a loop.

1
00:07.220 --> 00:12.800
But, you know, if you find yourself writing code, that's exactly the same, like maybe you originally

2
00:12.800 --> 00:19.400
did make a script that went and had all these hard codes in it and renamed each one individually, then

3
00:19.400 --> 00:21.710
its--that would be a good time to consider using a loop.

4
00:22.010 --> 00:26.620
Or maybe you've written some code that's not exactly the same, but it's, you know, pretty similar...

5
00:27.500 --> 00:33.200
you could add a loop statement there and then just add some if/else conditionals to check for certain

6
00:33.200 --> 00:33.710
things.

7
00:34.490 --> 00:41.120
Anytime you write a script, you might be needing to reuse some of that code, even if it's for

8
00:41.120 --> 00:42.710
like a completely different project.

9
00:42.980 --> 00:49.490
So in general, you want to try to recreate or write reuseable generic code.

10
00:50.330 --> 00:52.940
And if you're doing scripting for work, that's not always possible.

11
00:52.940 --> 00:57.620
And sometimes you just need to paste all your commands into a script and run it.  That can work,

12
00:57.620 --> 00:58.730
but it's also fragile.

13
00:59.030 --> 01:02.880
And if you're using hard codes, it's more likely to break.

14
01:04.070 --> 01:11.660
But the takeaway here is that while you're scripting this: to think about not repeating yourself while

15
01:11.660 --> 01:15.410
you're writing code, and if you are, it's time to use a loop.
