All right, so the for loop here is a very common one to use in shell scripting. Many systems admins

1
00:10.920 --> 00:15.060
and engineers will even use them outside of a script and just write them on the fly.

2
00:15.300 --> 00:18.240
As an example for your script--renaming script,

3
00:18.240 --> 00:25.380
you want to do you want to loop through all the files in this Pictures/ directory and do something to

4
00:25.380 --> 00:29.790
them so you can actually just write this out on the command line really quickly.

5
00:30.900 --> 00:37.830
So 'for f' in this folder and everything inside of it,

6
00:39.770 --> 00:43.400
'do' print the file name.

7
00:45.500 --> 00:51.860
I'm just going to put a 'sleep 1' in here, which is just a simple command to wait one second so you

8
00:51.860 --> 00:54.200
can kind of see how this is looping.

9
00:56.540 --> 01:03.860
So there is printing off all the file names here.  IMG9912, IMG9913, IMG9914--all those different files.

10
01:05.090 --> 01:14.660
So this is--this ad-hoc kind of a 'for' loop that you do here, systems engineers and admins will do this

11
01:14.660 --> 01:15.040
a lot.

12
01:15.050 --> 01:26.210
They'll type in...you know...'for f in ' "this-ten-servers, go log in and run this command and then be done."

13
01:26.540 --> 01:32.300
Because a lot of times you'll have to do the same command on, you know, 10 or 20--hundreds of servers

14
01:32.300 --> 01:32.990
all at once.

15
01:33.410 --> 01:34.580
There's other tools that do that

16
01:34.580 --> 01:40.310
but sometimes you just need to run one quick command and then that's a good way to just do it.

17
01:40.610 --> 01:43.430
So the 'for' loop is pretty useful.

18
01:45.080 --> 01:53.570
So if you did like an 'ls', you know--you'd get all the same information, but you're not actually looping

19
01:53.570 --> 01:54.120
through it.

20
01:54.380 --> 01:57.050
This is just a list of all the files.

21
01:57.560 --> 02:01.970
So let's port this over to your script in the next lecture.
