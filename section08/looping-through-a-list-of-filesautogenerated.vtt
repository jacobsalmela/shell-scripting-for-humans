Let's move this--this little 'for' loop into a shell script and see what we can do with it. And I think

1
00:11.020 --> 00:18.410
we're going to try to rename these files to make the IMG characters all lowercase, just as a good example.

2
00:19.930 --> 00:26.470
So let's make a lowercase.sh.   "i" for Insert.

3
00:29.560 --> 00:30.760
#!/bin/bash

4
00:34.820 --> 00:36.380
This--yeah--renames files to all lowercase

5
00:45.540 --> 00:48.210
'for f in ./*; do'

6
00:51.760 --> 00:54.430
And then let's just do and 'echo' statement, to make sure we got this right.

7
01:12.490 --> 01:14.160
Let's run it--./lowercase.sh

8
01:16.450 --> 01:22.600
Yep, OK.  But let's add an 'if' statement only do those IMG files in there.

9
01:29.420 --> 01:30.130
So let's do

10
01:36.610 --> 01:45.640
'if [[ -f $f ]]' So if $f is a file, 'then'

11
01:59.780 --> 02:07.100
So our 'deer' directory was in there, so we didn't show that, so that's good; but still we only

12
02:07.100 --> 02:12.920
want the images. So we can actually just do that.

13
02:16.660 --> 02:17.950
And there's all our images.

14
02:20.620 --> 02:20.980
Right.

15
02:21.010 --> 02:26.950
So before you can actually learn how to start renaming these files to all lowercase, I have to teach

16
02:26.950 --> 02:31.780
you about the pipe character that looks just like this.
