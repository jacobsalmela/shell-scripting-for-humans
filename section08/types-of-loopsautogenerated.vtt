OK, I'm going to clear this. There's loops that you can use in your shell, just like most programming

1
00:09.660 --> 00:13.710
languages, there's actually different kind of loops that you can use for different situations.

2
00:14.430 --> 00:19.490
The syntax is a little bit different, but in general, you'll find these types of loops:

3
00:19.740 --> 00:25.730
There's a 'for' loop, which is just a simple way to loop an arbitrary amount of times.

4
00:27.390 --> 00:31.620
There's a 'while' loop which lets you loop until a certain condition is true.

5
00:32.460 --> 00:38.490
And then there's a 'case', a statement also called a 'switch' statement, which is kind of like a loop,

6
00:39.150 --> 00:46.230
but you can basically predefine a bunch of criteria to match and the default value if nothing is matched.

7
00:48.330 --> 00:52.190
So in the next lecture, I'm going to show you about the for loop.

8
00:52.500 --> 00:56.940
It's one of the most versatile ones you'll use, and I think you'll enjoy it.
